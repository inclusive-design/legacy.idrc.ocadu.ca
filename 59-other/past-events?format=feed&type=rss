			<description><![CDATA[Up until now, making content available for people with disabilities has been    a relatively uninspiring process. While the results provide people with disabilities    with a sense of the work, the artist\'s involvement is missing and some of the    original energy of the performance may go missing as well. <p>What happens when artists become involved in looking at access from a creative    perspective? Can you make your paintings heard or your music seen? In how many    difference senses can your dance be felt? What happens when you paint your poem    or sculpt your song? Can you undertake this challenge while still maintaining    your focus?</p> <p>Please Join Wendy Porch, Charles Silverman and Leesa Levinson for a half day    workshop that explores how making accessible content can bring added benefits    to both artist and audience.</p> <p>This workshop will also introduce participants to Culturall and Stretch, two    multi-partner projects that include The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre    (University of Toronto), Ryerson\'s Disability Studies Program and the Canadian    Abilities Foundation, to look at the potential for inclusive design to act as    a catalyst for innovation and creativity.</p> <p>Participants will be given the opportunity to try out new and innovative tools    developed as part of these projects that will assist in making their art more    inclusive of everyone.</p>         <br />       <table width="50%" cellpadding="4" border="0" align="left">       &nbsp;              <tbody><tr>          <td style="width: 24%">Date</td>         <td style="width: 76%"><p>Oct. 26, 2005</p>           </td></tr>       <tr>          <td> Time:</td>         <td><p><br />10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>           </td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td style="height: 65px">Revised Location:</td>         <td>           <p><br />Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, <br />             Robarts Library<br />             130 St. George St., First Floor<br />             Toronto, ON, Canada<br /> </p></td>       </tr>     </tbody></table>     <h4>&nbsp; </h4>     <h4>&nbsp;</h4>     <h4>&nbsp;</h4>     <h4>Registration is free.
