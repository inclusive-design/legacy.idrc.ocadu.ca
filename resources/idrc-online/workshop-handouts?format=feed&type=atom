		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The stated purpose of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (2005) is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards in order to achieve accessibility for Ontarians with disabilities with respect to goods, services, facilities, accommodation, employment, buildings, structures and premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility will be achieved through the implementation of Standards in the areas of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transportation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information and Communications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built Environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IDRC recognizes that businesses will need help to ensure that their information and communications systems are compliant with the accessible ICT standard. In response to this need, the IDRC will be working with several continuing studies programs to offer an AODA Information and Communications Specialist Certification Program. Our goal with the certification program is to train individuals in evaluating and planning information and communications systems and practices that are compliant with the Accessible Information and Communications standard  and to provide a mechanism for business owners to choose qualified professionals to assist them with their AODA compliance needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Additional Resources:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesson.ca&quot;&gt;AccessOn.ca&lt;/a&gt; - a website focused on providing information on how to make businesses and communities more accessible to people with disabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070429_e.htm&quot;&gt;AODA Accessibility Standards&lt;/a&gt; - A central resource for the five standards as they are released for public review, and are adopted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tutorials on alternate format production - Coming soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
