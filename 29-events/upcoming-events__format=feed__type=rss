			<description><![CDATA[<p> (Toronto, September 12, 2011) The Inclusive Design Institute (IDI) at OCAD University will host a forum to gather comment on the proposed amendment to the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (Ontario Regulation 191/11) under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 , Design of Public Spaces in the Built Environment. </p>
<hr>

<p>The goal of the Accessibility Standards for the Built Environment is to remove barriers to access in public spaces and buildings to make it easier for all Ontarians , including people with disabilities, seniors and families , to access the places where they work, travel, shop and play.</p>

<p>The event, organized as a roundtable discussion of the amendment by an expert panel and stakeholders. Comments and discussion by our expert panel will be followed by a session for open questions and discussion. An overview of the background to this proposed accessibility standard will be provided by David Lepofsky, Chair of the non-partisan Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance, the community coalition that has spearheaded the province-wide campaign to make Ontario fully accessible for persons with disabilities. The IDI will document the event and send the conclusions and comments to the Ministry Community and Social Services before the amendment's comment deadline of October 1, 2012. Members of the media and the public are invited.</p>
