<p><strong>Project Descriptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.achecker.ca">AChecker Accessibility Checker</a>
<p>This is a model system that demonstrates how web pages may be checked for accessibility problems. The accessibility checks in this system are based upon the proposed Open Accessibility Checks (OAC), a universal series of tests that may be applied to HTML pages to determine their compliance with accessibility standards.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atutor.ca/">ATutor</a>
<p>ATutor is an Open Source Web-based Learning&nbsp; Management System (LMS) designed with accessibility and adaptability in mind. ATutor's availability as Open Source makes it a cost effective tool for both small and large organizations presenting their instructional materials on the Web, or delivering fully independent online courses. With ATutor, students learn in an adaptive learning environment.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://adod.idrc.ocad.ca/node/1" title="Accessible Digital Office Document">Accessible Digital Office Document</a>
<p>ADOD is developing vendor-neutral guidance related to digital office documents, including: a harmonized framework, based on W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 1.0, for determining the accessibility of office documents, office document formats and office applications; a set of practical application-specific, but vendor-neutral instructions, on how to create accessible office documents from common office application suites. ADOD is being developed in partnership with UNESCO and the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://aegis.idrc.ocad.ca/">ÆGIS Ontario: Integrating Accessibility into Emerging ICT<br /></a>
<p>The ÆGIS(Ontario) project, funded by the Ontario Research Fund Research Excellence program, is working in close partnership with ÆGIS(Europe) to ensure that emerging information and communication technologies (ICT) are designed inclusively, thereby supporting Ontario's commitment to equal access and preparing Ontario's ICT businesses to meet the growing global demand for products and services that provide accessibility to people of all abilities. Along with the IDRC, ÆGIS(Ontario) also includes researchers at Ryerson University, the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, York University, and the University of Toronto.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aegis-project.eu/" title="AEGIS:Integrating Accessibility into Emerging ICT (EU)">ÆGIS EU: Integrating Accessibility into Emerging ICT<br /></a>
<p>The ÆGIS(Europe) project is a major open source accessibility project funded by the European Commission. This 20-member consortium (including the IDRC) seeks to use third generation access techniques to deeply embed accessibility into mainstream ICT (desktop, rich Internet and mobile applications). This approach is developed and explored with the Open Accessibility Framework (OAF) through which aspects of the design, development and deployment of accessible mainstream ICT are addressed. The OAF provides embedded and built-in accessibility solutions, as well as toolkits for developers, for “engraving” accessibility in existing and emerging mass-market ICT-based products, thus making accessibility open, plug and play, personalised and configurable, realistic and applicable in various contexts. All developments will be iteratively tested with a significant number of end users, developers and experts in 3 phases and 4 Pilot sites Europe-wide (in Belgium, Spain, Sweden and the UK).</p>
<p>The project includes strong industrial and end user participation (the participating industries are among the market leaders in the corresponding mainstream ICT markets). The project results’ uptake is promoted by strong standardisation activities, as well as the fact that much of the technology results will be either new open source applications or will be built into existing and already widely adopted open source ICT.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="/index.php/component/content/article/41-research-and-development/new-projects/395-bridging-gaps">Bridging Gaps to Access &amp; Employment in the Entertainment &amp; Media Industries for Persons with Disabilities</a>
<p>The Bridging Gaps to Access &amp; Employment in the Entertainment &amp; Media Industries for Persons with Disabilities project focuses on the transfer of knowledge gained in the development and implementation of a uniquely accessible online support system with social networking and an online learning system to an industry where clients with disabilities experience barriers and are underutilized. &nbsp;An integrated management system and data base for artists will provide a referral service for employment; support casting directors, host online courses, and introduce social networking tools for community building.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://cloud4all.info/">Cloud4All</a>
<p>Cloud4all is an European Commission FP7 grant that will develop key parts of the <a href="http://gpii.net">Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII)</a>, building the knowledge base and algorithms needed and evaluating the ability of the concept to work across platforms, technologies and applications.</p>
</li>
<li>Enabling Change
<p>The goal of the project was to create accessible infrastructure to both train and provide support in implementing the AODA. The infrastructure will be initially applied to support the Customer Service and Information and Communication standards but will be broadly applicable. The infrastructure itself provides an exemplary, sustainable implementation of the I&amp;C standard.

<p><strong>Project Descriptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Automated Personalization Computer Project (APCP)<br /> In collaboration with the American Job Centers, community colleges, and high schools, the APCP project will help take the auto-personalization function of the <a href="https://gpii.net/">Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure</a> (GPII) from the proof-of-concept stage through to a high-quality, broadly-used open source implementation. Led by the TRACE Center at the University of Maryland, the IDRC is contributing to the project’s overall software architecture, security and web personalization infrastructure, and individualized metrics-gathering tools. <br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://bigidea.one/">BIG IDeA</a><br /> BIG IDeA (Business Innovation Guide for Inclusion Design and Accessibility) brings together businesses, customers with lived experience of disability and designers to collaboratively advance accessibility innovation in Ontario and create a culture of accessibility and inclusion. We are:
<ul>
<li>Collecting inclusion barriers and hosting design challenges to create inclusive alternatives</li>
<li>Mapping accessibility of Ontario in our BIG IDeA mapathon (visit: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/kllbe44">https://tinyurl.com/kllbe44</a>])</li>
<li>Recognizing accessible businesses through customer reviews, showcases and badges</li>
<li>Providing resources, training and help on inclusion and AODA compliance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://bodiesintranslation.wordpress.com/">Bodies in Translation</a><br /> Bodies in Translation is a research project that creates collaborative partnerships between artists, arts organizations, activists, scholars, and educators. With the Canadian disability arts community, the IDRC is co-designing the project’s Knowledge Platform as well as new technologies to support inclusive artistic creation. <br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cast.org/whats-new/news/2017/center-for-inclusive-software-for-learning.html">Center on Inclusive Software for Learning (CISL)</a><br /> This project brings inclusive open education tools and knowledge from the <a href="https://floeproject.org">FLOE Project</a> to the newly-announced <a href="http://www.cast.org/whats-new/news/2017/center-for-inclusive-software-for-learning.html">Center on Inclusive Software for Learning (CISL)</a>. Led by <a href="http://www.cast.org/">CAST</a>, CISL will support the development of an open-source software suite, industry guidelines and supporting research to ensure K-12 students get engaging personalized learning through Open Education Resources.<br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://opendoors.idrc.ocadu.ca/">Our Doors are Open</a><br /> <em>Our Doors Are Open: A Multi-Faith Welcome to Persons with Disabilities</em> will develop good practices for inclusive community engagement by places of worship of all faiths across Ontario, and support them to achieve a culture of inclusion in services and community gatherings. Our Doors are Open will provide:
<ul>
<li>training-materials and resources,</li>
<li>community inclusion workshops</li>
<li>train-the-trainer seminars</li>
<li>accessibility assessments and guidance on digital communications</li>
<li>accessibility mapathon kits to help you build awareness in your congregation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.coop/">Platform Co-op/</a><br /> In collaboration with the Platform Co-op movement, the goal of the project is to realize the full aspirations of Platform for Economic Inclusion. Together with Trebor Scholtz, the Platform Co-op Consortium and the New School, the IDRC will be developing a Platform Co-op Development Kit with the support of several foundations. The first implementation will be focused on care: childcare, attendant care and eldercare. “The work that makes all other work possible." <br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.iskme.org/our-work/preferences-global-access">Preferences for Global Access</a><br />The goal of this project is the design and development of web software to assist users with disabilities in creating online user profiles that specify their needs and preferences for how online information and services should be presented to them. The key to ensuring successful access to information and services is a personal statement expressing needs and preferences for specific contexts and goals. These "preference sets" automatically configure information and applications to meet individual. This team is developing tools and technologies to support users in specifying their individual needs and preferences in several application settings.<br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.raisingthefloor.org/prosperity4all/">Prosperity4All</a><br />Prosperity4All develops the infrastructure and ecosystem that will allow for a ubiquitous auto-personalization of interfaces and materials, based on user needs and preferences, to grow (promote self-rewarding collaboration, reduce redundant development, lower costs, increase market reach and penetration internationally).</li>
<li><a href="http://sojustrepairit.org">The Social Justice Repair Kit</a><br /> The goal of this project is to
<ul>
<li>help youth movements and social justice initiatives to become welcoming environments for youth with learning differences</li>
<li>benefit from the advantages of inclusive design.<a href="http://sojustrepairit.org"></a></li>
</ul>
