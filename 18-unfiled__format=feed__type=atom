		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The IDRC is a vibrant research and development centre at OCAD University where an international community of open source developers, designers, researchers, advocates, and volunteers work together to help ensure that emerging information technology and practices are designed inclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a flexible non-profit work environment and are committed to designing software and best practices that are inclusive of the full range of human diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on our projects, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;/index.php/research-and-development&quot; title=&quot;IDRC Research &amp;amp; Development&quot;&gt;Research and Development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Position: Inclusive Developer (AI &amp;amp; Machine Learning)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Data and algorithms aren't neutral—they reflect our biases, hidden assumptions, and systemic exclusions. Want to use your development skills to address these issues of equity and inclusion? Project We Count will examine discrimination and exclusion of persons with disabilities in the field of AI and machine learning, in collaboration with the people who have direct experience of this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As an Inclusive Developer at the IDRC, you will help to build new systems that show how we can creatively address inequities in this rapidly growing field. Your job will include collaborating with other developers and designers to build web-based user interfaces for inclusive AI, participating in and supporting co-design sessions, and building project websites.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
