		<p>Kevin K. Nguyen and Linda S. Petty<br />            Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC), University of Toronto, Ontario,            Canada<br />          </p>      		<br />  		                      <p>The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre                   (ATRC), University of Toronto coordinated efforts with                   the Diversity Management Directorate (DMD), Public                   Services Commission of Canada to systematically evaluate                   how commercial World Wide Web (WWW) browsers functioned                   with various types of adaptive technology under                   different operating systems. The types of adaptive                   technology examined include screen magnifiers, scanning                   / switch access systems, alternative keyboards, screen                   readers, Morse code input devices and voice recognition                   systems. The objectives of the project were to: document                   the strengths and weaknesses of controlling different                   browsers with a representative set of adaptive                   technologies and operating systems; note customizations                   of the assistive devices or browsers that were needed                   for effective control; incorporate feedback from                   manufacturers of the adaptive technology products into                   the final document; and summarize the research findings                   into a set of bilingual, on-line guidelines targeted at                   users with disabilities. Important information was                   obtained that provided clues for what needs to be done                   on both the browser and adaptive technology sides to                   make web browsing accessible.</p>                                 <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>                    <p>The popularity and pervasiveness of the World Wide Web has              increased exponentially over the last few years; however, the              mouse-based point-and-click interface that makes the Web              appealing as a method of serving information also creates              barriers for people with disabilities. There are several              commercial assistive technology devices currently available              that allow people with disabilities to access their computer              systems (11,12). These include voice recognition systems,              screen readers, screen magnifiers, Morse code input devices              and alternative keyboards. However, how well do these              assistive computer devices, often an add-on to most computer              systems, work with standard interfaces such as Internet Web              browsers? Information on how access technology and browsers              work together is relatively uncommon. Users with disabilities              have often relied on their own trial and error methods to              determine how their adaptive technology devices can access              the Internet. A joint venture formed between the Diversity              Management Directorate (DMD) of the Public Service Commission              and the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) of the              Information Commons, University of Toronto to help eliminate              the lack of information on how various adaptive technologies              and Web browsers work together.              <br />               </p>                    <h3>Objectives of the Project</h3>                    <ul> <li>To document the strengths and weaknesses in                   controlling browser functions of a full range of access                   technologies.</li><li>To document any customization required for effective                   use of the adaptive technology products with the                   identified web browsers.</li><li>To inform the manufacturers of each adaptive                   technology product tested of the results of the research                   on their product and to incorporate their feedback into                   the final &quot;How To&quot; guidelines.</li><li>To address the direction needed to overcome future                   access barriers.</li><li>To prepare a final report explaining the tools and                   methodologies were used, the results found, and the                   customization which will be of most help.</li><li>To summarize the research results in a set of &quot;How                   To&quot; guidelines targeted at users with disabilities to be                   converted into accessible HyperText Markup Language                   (HTML) format for posting on the DMD and ATRC web                   sites.</li> </ul>                    <p><br /> <br /> <br />                                           </p>                    <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>                    <p>The Diversity Management Directorate provided funding to              develop guidelines and practical tools to help persons with              disabilities access the WWW using identified adaptive              technologies. The project began March 1, 1996 and the              majority of testing and report writing was completed on May              17, 1996. Further support was provided by the DMD to              translate the information into French and to convert all              information into accessible HTML format for publication on              the ATRC and the DMD web sites. A simultaneous public launch              of the web project took place on January 20, 1997.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <h3>Product testing</h3>                    <p>Adaptive technology products were selected for the project              based on availability and consumer interest. In particular,              screen reading software has received considerable interest              and controversy over its ability to access web browser              features, so leading products in this group were targeted for              testing. A representative sampling of technology for              alternative keyboard and mouse control was also tested, as              very little attention has been paid to this area in the              literature or in adaptive technology conferences. Browsers              were selected based on market share and popularity (1st              Quarter 1996) and reviewed mainly in the Windows 95/Windows              3.1 and Macintosh OS environments. Netscape Navigator was the              browser of choice for most testing, with some products also              tested on Microsoft&#39;s Internet Explorer as the strongest              contender. IBM&#39;s Web Explorer for OS/2Warp and the commonly              used text-based web browser, Lynx, were reviewed in the DOS              and UNIX platforms, to accommodate individuals using these              operating systems. Testing included accessing the features of              each browser&#39;s menus, buttons, status bar, etc.-- and              navigation of web pages, hypertext links, forms, frames, etc.              Each combination of browser and assistive technology was              tested with the known content of the ATRC web site and with a              mixture of other web sites, including Netscape&#39;s home page              and form-based search engine pages such as Infoseek and              Lycos.</p>                    <p>Before testing the adaptive technology it was necessary to              carefully review each browser and list its features and              requirements for use. Comprehensive documents for each              browser version were produced describing features and              providing other important information such as keyboard              equivalents for menu items, etc. It is anticipated that the              browser information will be helpful to users who want to              learn about available browsers prior to selecting or using              one. The documentation is also useful for learning about              available configurations and customizations for each product.              Knowledge of browser keystroke equivalents can be invaluable              for automating and optimizing commands for users of adaptive              technology. Also, many browsers only have help files              available on-line; thus, the collected browser information              can be a useful off-line reference tool.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <h3>Investigator Profiles</h3>                    <p>Five ATRC student-staff were involved in the testing and              writing process. The students were finishing the third or              fourth year of their university studies and were familiar              with both assistive technology and browsing the World Wide              Web. Three of the students have disabilities and so were able              to test the products from the perspective of consumers. Four              other people with disabilities were paid an honorarium to              test the browser/assistive technology combinations and              provide us with their feedback. These four individuals used a              screen reader, Morse code, single switch scanning and              alternative keyboard input respectively to access computer              systems. One user tested Lynx at home using his own screen              reader; the remaining users came to the ATRC for testing. The              ATRC assistant manager reviewed several products and assisted              in the user testing to ensure optimal access setups. The              assistant manager also solicited the feedback from the              software developers/product manufacturers and arranged for              equipment purchases or loans for the project.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <h3>Browsers and Assistive Technology Products Reviewed:</h3>                    <p>World Wide Web Browser Software              <br />               Documents identifying functions and features, keyboard              equivalents, and other useful access information were              collected for the following browsers:</p>                    <ul> <li>Netscape 2.0 for the Macintosh</li><li>Netscape 2.0 for Windows 95</li><li>Netscape 2.0 for Windows 3.1</li><li>Internet Explorer for Windows 95</li><li>Internet Explorer for Windows 3.1</li><li>NCSA Mosaic for Windows 3.1</li><li>NCSA Mosaic for Windows 95</li><li>DosLynx</li><li>Lynx 2.6 for Unix</li><li>IBM Web Explorer for OS/2 Warp</li> </ul>                    <p>Assistive Technology Products              <br />               The following products were reviewed, as listed, in              conjunction with web browser and operating system:</p>                    <p>Screen Enlargement programs</p>                    <ul> <li>ZoomText for Windows 3.1 with Netscape 1.1</li><li>ZoomText for Windows 95 with Netscape                   2.0</li><li>InLarge for the Macintosh with Netscape 2.0</li> </ul>                    <p>Scanning access methods</p>                    <ul> <li>Ke:nx 3.0 for the Macintosh and Netscape 2.0</li><li>WiViK 2.2 for Windows 3.1 and 95 and Netscape                   2.0</li> </ul>                    <p>Alternative keyboards with mouse emulation</p>                    <ul> <li>Glide point ALPs keyboard for the PC</li><li>Intellikeys expanded keyboard for Mac and PC</li><li>TASH Mini keyboard for the Mac</li> </ul>                    <p>Screen Readers</p>                    <ul> <li>ASAP and Lynx in the UNIX/DOS environment</li><li>IBM ScreenReader/2 with IBM Web Explorer</li><li>Outspoken with Netscape and Internet Explorer</li><li>Jaws for Windows with Netscape 2.0</li><li>Screen Power for Windows with Netscape 2.0</li> </ul>                    <p>Voice Recognition</p>                    <ul> <li>Dragon Dictate 2.0 with Internet Explorer and                   Netscape in Windows &#39;95</li><li>Dragon Dictate 1.1 with Netscape and Internet                   Explorer in Windows 3.1</li><li>Kurzweil LawTalk for Windows 3.1 with Netscape                   2.0</li><li>Power Secretary for the Macintosh with Netscape                   2.0</li> </ul>                    <p>Morse Code access</p>                    <ul> <li>Mini-Morse with Macintosh with Netscape 2.0</li><li>Mini-Morse with Windows 3.1 and Netscape 2.0</li> </ul>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <h3>Information Dissemination</h3>                    <p>The results were compiled into an integrated set of public              guidelines posted on the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre              and the Diversity Management Directorate Internet sites in              both French and English. The Public Services Commission of              Canada provided French translation and both versions of the              documents were converted from various word processor format              into HTML 2.0. The complete set of guidelines was entitled              &quot;Universal Internet Access Project&quot; and &quot;Projet              d&#39;acc&egrave;s universel &agrave; l&#39;Internet&quot; and is linked              to from the following URLs: <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc">http://idrc.ocad.ca</a> and              <a href="http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/">http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/</a>. Several features of              the site were added during the process of HTML conversion to              increase the overall experience and resource value. All pages              were rendered accessible for the users of screen readers              (4,6,9). ALT-text was provided for all images and all              graphical links had text equivalents. Also, each page              contained a set of standardized &quot;page navigators&quot; that              allowed easy movement through the resource. Contact              information for all products reviewed was provided as well as              direct hypertext links to company web pages and electronic              mail addresses (2). In addition, a glossary of adaptive              technology and Web browser terminology was integrated into              the site (8). This is an invaluable resource for anyone new              to adaptive technology or/and the Internet. The guidelines              also invited electronic mail, fax, and telephone feedback              from readers about their own findings or suggestions for              future product reviews (1).</p>                    <p><br /> <br /> <br />                                           </p>                    <h2>RESULTS</h2>                    <h3>Summary of Results/Findings</h3>                    <p>The research yielded some surprising results and some              important details on known problems and issues. The full 120              page listing of results can be linked to from <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc">http://idrc.ocad.ca</a>or <a href="http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/">http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/</a>.The following              general conclusions were drawn from the collected, in-depth              individual reviews of assistive technology and browsers:</p>                    <ul> <li>Although Netscape Navigator was the acknowledged                   leader among web browsers at the time, Internet Explorer                   2.0 offered some useful access features, such as                   commands to universally increase or decrease the font                   size of the text on the web page. Internet Explorer                   appeared to have been created primarily as a Windows 95                   tool and was less intuitive to use in its Windows 3.1                   version.</li><li>Screen enlargement packages generally worked well                   with web browsers in the Macintosh, Windows 3.1 and 95                   environments, although color palette conflicts existed                   in some Windows video modes. For proficient use of                   screen enlarger with browser, the user required that the                   browser window be resized to the viewable area.                   Otherwise, following text in the browser window became                   confusing.</li><li>Four of the screen reading packages for graphical                   user interfaces were tested, with very mixed results.                   The best function found during the testing period                   required macro files to configure the screen reader for                   the browser, which limited the user&#39;s choice of                   software. No screen reader tested was able to clearly                   present information found on a web page containing                   groupings of graphics, text and information in columns.                   If text information was broken by columns, frames and                   graphics, then it was very difficult for the user to                   gain a comprehensive and cohesive understanding of the                   page contents in a short time. Frames and columns or                   mixed text and graphics are challenges still to be fully                   conquered by many screen readers (5,9,13).</li><li>Voice recognition software works best when using                   built-in macros for accessing standard menu features and                   these vary in availability with off the shelf packages.                   Mouse control of web browser features is somewhat                   difficult and much more time consuming using voice                   recognition than the use of equivalent spoken menu                   commands.</li><li>Alternative keyboards with built in mouse emulation                   worked adequately for browser access, as was expected.                   The ability to move quickly from one hypertext link to                   the next would have benefited testers with motor skill                   deficits.</li><li>Scanning for single or dual switch users can be                   configured to permit functional control of a browser.                   Scanning browser functions can provide a more direct                   access than simply using a switch to operate mouse                   emulation. For example, scanning to and selecting a                   &quot;Scroll Down&quot; scan menu function can be more efficient                   than selecting &quot;Mouse Right&quot; to move the pointer to the                   scroll bar and then subsequently trying to manipulate                   the scroll bar with the mouse pointer. Further                   development is needed to produce efficient scanning                   interfaces for browsers that suit a variety of                   platforms, switch access skills and software                   interfaces.</li><li>Morse code access provided adequate mouse control                   and text input for a browser. The smoothest interface is                   one that provides the greatest ease of mouse control, as                   most surfing can be done through mouse emulation.</li><li>Frames are a challenge to many assistive technology                   users (5,7). First, the user must know that frames are                   present. A frame will not be read by a screen reader                   unless it is selected and given focus. For the graphical                   browsers reviewed, switching focus between frames was                   only possible through mouse control. Only after the                   frame is selected can a user navigate the frame using a                   screen reader, voice recognition system or a scanning                   array.</li><li>A keyboard equivalent for moving forward and                   backward through hyperlinks would be useful for most                   alternative access tools. Screen Reader/2 and Jaws for                   Windows provided this in Web Explorer 2.0 and Netscape                   2.0 respectively. This feature would be useful to                   alternative keyboard users and other screen reading                   packages if built into the browser itself.</li> </ul>                    <p><br /> <br /> <br />                                           </p>                    <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>                    <p>This project was valuable in confirming the effectiveness,              and identifying the inadequacies, of various assistive              technology devices for World Wide Web access. Detailed              reviews of each product with at least one web browser              provided much useful information on the product&#39;s              functionality. As the products approached screen reading or              mouse emulation differently, their effectiveness in              controlling web browsers varied considerably. The most useful              configurations of both the assistive technology and the              browsers were also identified, allowing a reader of resulting              guidelines to start with a customized configuration of the              software in advance. A number of technical obstacles were              encountered in setting up both the browsers and the assistive              technology, demonstrating that substantial time and technical              support is required to support not only a project like this              but also individuals wishing to access the Web through              adaptive technology.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <h3>Manufacturer/Developer-Consumer Relationships</h3>                    <p>Liaisons with the manufacturers/software developers were              made by phone or in person at the CSUN Technology and Persons              with Disabilities conference in March 1996. Although there              was general support for our project, not all companies were              consistent or forthcoming in our request for feedback on the              product reviews. On-going discoveries of how to enhance the              utility of the adaptive technologies and web browsers were              relayed to the manufacturers. Several manufactures gave              constructive feedback on the project, sometimes requesting              re-phrasing of product descriptions or operational              information. Generally, they concurred with our findings and              sometimes requested that we document information on future              versions of their product which they claimed would improve              function with a web browser. On our recommendation,              Hentre-Joyce created new macros enabling their Jaws screen              reader to handle column text on web pages. Connections made              with consumers for user testing broadened our pool of              contacts for future user testing.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <h3>Access Issues</h3>                    <p>Columns and Frames: All tested screen readers read              across the page from left to right with disregard for column              boundaries. However, after this information was presented to              Hentre Joyce, their staff developed four custom Netscape              Navigator macros for the reading of columns. This information              was passed onto the public through our published guidelines.              To the detriment of accessibility, the use of multi-column              text may be increasing. A popular web publishing technique is              to use invisible tables to gain fine control of web page              design layout (10). Usually the entire page is embedded in a              complex table resulting in text presented in multiple columns              interspersed with images and links.</p>                    <p>Multiple invisible Frames are also being used the same way              tables are to gain control of the positioning of web page              elements (10); however, the problem is further compounded              with a focusing issue. Frames are generally inaccessible              because the user that is unable to use a mouse cannot control              which frame has focus. Only one frame can have focus at a              time so the user needs a way to easily alter focus between              multiple frames. Additionally, an action in one frame may              result in a change in another frame, of which a person using              a screen reader would be unaware. In response to the focus              issue, the latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer              (version 3.0) provides a keystroke equivalent for this              feature.</p>                    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is considering a              recommendation for the addition of Cascading Style Sheets              (CSS) into HTML 3.2 that will allow absolute positioning of              elements within an HTML document (14). This will provide an              alternative for invisible tables and frames and hopefully              should increase the accessibility of web pages with complex              layout design if web page creators adopt these style              sheets.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <p>Hypertext Links: This project has supported the              fact that keyboard equivalents or hotkeys are fundamental to              the accessibility of a program. Automation of a frequently              used task (which would usually take several mouse movements)              into a single keystroke command can increase the efficiency              of web browser control at any level. The research              demonstrated a direct correlation between the number of tasks              automated and the ease of use of the program for web              surfing.</p>                    <p>Tasks that could not be performed directly with a              keystroke equivalent (i.e. choosing a hypertext link in              Netscape Navigator 2.0) were longer and more difficult to              complete. A simulated mouse mode usually needed to be              employed to choose a hypertext link. Controlling the mouse              pointer within a graphical user interface can a very              difficult and unintuitive task for the user of adaptive              technology. Innovative mouse movements systems such as sector              arc scanning (WiVik) and grid scanning (Dragon Dictate) can              make mouse navigation easier for some, but any function that              can be performed using a direct keystroke equivalent as              opposed to mouse manipulation should be favored by adaptive              technology users. Fortunately, industry has acknowledged the              access community and has recently incorporated keystroke              equivalents into their web browsers.</p>                    <p>At the start of the project, Netscape Navigator 2.0 and              Internet Explorer 2.0 were the latest versions available for              testing. Although these programs had built-in keystroke              equivalents to execute menu / toolbar functions and navigate              dialog boxes, they did not have keystroke equivalents for the              principal functionality of a web browser: navigating              hyperlinks. Soon after the completion of our project,              Microsoft Corporation&#39;s Windows Accessibility Group added              major navigation keystrokes to the release of Internet              Explorer 3.0. Tab, Shift-Tab allows the user to quickly move              between hyperlinks. Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab allows the              user to change focus between Frames. Combined, these new              features provide momentous functionality for both user and              non-users of adaptive technology. A foundation of native              keystroke equivalents can greatly increase accessibility to              any computer application. Macros for voice recognition and              screen reading are easier to create and custom keyboard              layouts are easier to make. It was found during the user              testing trials that Tab navigation for hyperlinks              circumvented the need for mouse control thus significantly              decreasing the effort needed for persons using Ke:nx and              single-switch scanning to select a hypertext links. Time              needed for choosing hypertexts link decreased from              approximately 2 minutes/link to approximately 15              seconds/link. Also, with Tab navigation of hyperlinks there              is no longer a problem with small targets for persons using              alternative pointing devices and/or lacking fine motor              control. Netscape Navigator 4.0 Beta also added keystroke              navigation features in response to an access committee which              included the ATRC.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <p>Browser Commands: Functions of a browser or any              other program can be accessed through either direct or              indirect keyboard equivalents. A direct keyboard equivalent              is defined as a combination of keys when pressed              simultaneously will execute an explicit command. An indirect              keyboard equivalent means a command must be navigated to              through a series of keyboard equivalents. There are              advantages and disadvantages to each.</p>                    <p>Direct keystroke equivalents can be quickly executed but              require memorizing the association between function and key              combination. However, there are several keystroke equivalents              reserved by the operating system (i.e. Ctrl+C to copy), so a              program can eventually run out of reasonable keystroke              combinations. &quot;Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F7+Ins&quot; is unreasonable.</p>                    <p>Indirect keystroke equivalents require more time to find              commands, but easy to follow hierarchies can exist. Most              adaptive technology programs adapt to such a hierarchy. For              example, if you have a program containing 50 commands, it is              easier to break them down into 5 groupings of 10 commands as              opposed to a single grouping of 50 commands. A well designed              program will use both methods. A frequently used command will              be quickly executed (via keystrokes, toolbar buttons, right              mouse button menu, etc.) as well as having the command              embedded in the menu bar hierarchy. The most commonly used              commands have direct keystroke equivalents while the less              commonly used commands reside in the menus hierarchy that can              be accessed through indirect keystrokes.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <h3>New Access Challenges</h3>                    <p>Future access tools may need to become HTML-aware in order              to deal with the increasing complexity of web page formats              (7). These access tools would do more than simply relay the              information presented in the browser window. They would parse              the HTML and present it in a browser-independent accessible              format best suited for the user. pwWebspeak is one example of              such a tool.</p>                    <p>However simply being HTML aware may not be enough.              HyperText Markup Language, the foundation of the World Wide              Web, is slowly evolving into an application programming              interface. It is no longer just the HTML document itself that              needs to be accessible, but also the embedded in-line,              interactive components (12). Before graphical web browsers              such as Netscape and Mosaic, when the WWW was mostly text              based, people with disabilities could functionally access the              Internet using screen readers. Any obstacles that were              encountered were usually not fundamental to the experience of              the web site. However, today the World Wide Web is largely              image based and is becoming increasingly more dynamic. The              Web browser is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application              within a GUI operating system with access obstacles such as              tables, columnar text, graphical icons and bitmapped text.              Increasing bandwidth will lead to increases in multimedia              content and interactivity.</p>                    <p>The functionality of browsers such as Netscape Navigator              and Microsoft Internet Explorer can be greatly expanded              through either third party plug-ins, such as Macromedia&#39;s              Shockwave player; or embedded components/objects, such as              Java applets. Accessing/interpreting and controlling the              visual information from embedded applets will become              increasingly important for screen readers and alternate              access tools. However, because applets and plug-ins have the              ability to add functionality to a web page they may provide a              means to increase web page accessibility; for example, they              may present the same information through multiple              modalities.</p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                    <h3>Scope of Project and Future Direction</h3>                    <p>The project undertaken was ambitious, attempting to              document the features and functions of the major web browsers              and provide in-depth reviews of a representative sampling of              assistive technology products in 10 weeks or less. The list              of web browsers analyzed is substantial and this work will              not need to be repeated, only updated, as new versions are              released. Previously, the information was collected in a word              processor and manually converted by a single HTML editor. In              the future, the researchers will directly code their projects              in HTML. An HTML template is now provided for future              reviewers wishing to update the project. The Diversity              Management Directorate will provide French translations of              future results.</p>                    <p>Subsequent phases of the project will be to address a              broader range of assistive technology products on the market,              or being released in the near future. The potential for              expansion of this project is based on product needs in each              category.</p>                    <ul> <li>Screen Readers: Other GUI screen readers to be                   tested include Arctic WinVision, Syntha-Voice Window                   Bridge, GW Micro Window Bridge and Vocal Eyes.

Ke:nx version 4.0                   could provide important improvements in scan line access                   for the Macintosh. Further switch and Morse code access                   to Windows can be investigated with Madenta&#39;s Windows                   products, SofType and EZKeys.</li> </ul>                    <p><br /> <br /> <br />                                           </p>                    <h2>ACKNOWLEDEGMENTS</h2>                    <p>This research was supported through funding from the              Public Services Commission of Canada, Industry Canada.
