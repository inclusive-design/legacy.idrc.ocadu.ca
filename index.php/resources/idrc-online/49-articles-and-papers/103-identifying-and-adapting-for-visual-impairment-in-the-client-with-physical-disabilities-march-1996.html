		</script>            <br />             </p>                <p>A cross-over of knowledge is needed between traditional            vision specialists and the parents, therapists and teachers            of children with physical disabilities. Studies show some            75-90% of children with severe impairments have a visual            impairment and that 30-60% of individuals with a diagnosis of            cerebral palsy(C.P.) have some form of visual impairment such            as visual acuity loss, eye muscle imbalances, visual field            deficits, visual perceptual skill delays and processing            problems (Beukelman &amp; Mirenda 1992; Erhardt, 1990;            Mirenda &amp; Mathy-Laikko, 1989).</p>                <p>Computers and alternative and augmentative            communication(AAC) aids are generally visually based and can            be adapted for motor impairment, whereas software and            hardware modifications for the blind require normal hand            function for full keyboard operation. When visual deficits            are added to physical disabilities, different considerations            are required to assist in accessing and device use. The            purpose of this paper is to provide clinicians and educators            with an understanding of:</p>                <ul> <li>the impact of neurological impairments on ocular                 motor control</li><li>the implications of tactile dysfunction in the                 neurologically impaired client</li><li>the visual and physical demands of accessing                 computers and communication aids</li><li>the components of functional vision and the effects                 of their impairment on augmentative communication                 device/aid design</li><li>general strategies and adaptations for enhansing                 visualization of communication aids/devices, computer                 use and educational materials.</li> </ul>               <br /> <br />                            <h2>NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT OF MOTOR FUNCTION AND OCULARMOTOR            CONTROL</h2>                <p>Muscle Tone Disturbances:Tone refers to the degree            of muscle tension and its resultant resistance to stretching.            Persistent extremes of muscle tone are termed hypotonicity            for decreased or low tone and hypertonicity for increased            tone. Muscle tone affects eye musculature, impacting on            ocular-motor control.</p>                <h3>Hypotonicity/Low Tone</h3>             Low tone can influence how well children direct their gaze,            as the head is kept in a position to facilitate trunk support            and postural control. Eye movement and field of vision may be            limited by the hyperextended neck postion. In the child with            C.P., a hypotonic trunk is frequently paired with increased            tone in the upper and lower extremities. Seating and            positioning strategies are used to compensate for low tone            when sitting in a wheelchair. For less impaired children,            ensure proper seating with the feet flat on the floor and            forearms stabilized on a table surface when the child is to            manipulate objects in midline. If asked to work with the arms            unsupported, the child may slump to one side and the effort            of maintaining posture in the chair may reduce attention to            the task at hand. With the trunk and head supported in            mid-line, the mild or severely involved child is able to            direct their gaze more functionally, although they may limit            head turning to look to the periphery so as not to lose head            control (Levack, 1991).               <h3>Hypertonicity/Increased Tone</h3>             Certain muscles are maintained in an excited state of            excessive tension and resistance to stretch. Although these            &quot;tight&quot; muscles give the appearance of strength, in reality            their hypertonic state limits efficient control and            coordination of movement. Increased tone also affects the eye            musculature, as follows.               <p>Extensor Spasticity: A pattern of whole body            extension is commonly seen in children under 7 years with            spasticity. The extension is usually accompanied by neck            hyperextension and the eyes held in elevation. In unsupported            lying on the back, the child will not be able to direct their            gaze straight up or down towards their feet. A wedge cushion            behind the head/shoulders can break the pattern of            hyperextension by giving a chin tuck postition. In this            position, visual stimuli can be presented in mid to lower            fields, with stimuli behind the child s back minimized to            inhibit eye elevation. When the child is supported in            standing the preferred range for visual motor activities is            wide ranges out to the side at shoulder height. Arm movements            to the side at shoulder level facilitate active trunk            extension, normalizing postural tone and therefore providing            the greatest freedom for the eyes. Work at an easel is used            so the eyes are looking ahead or in a slight depression. In a            seated position, support will optimally allow the child to            dissociate eyes from head and head from trunk and upper limbs            (Geniale, 1991).</p>                <p>Flexor Spasticity: With this pattern the child            pulls forward with head and trunk and arm flexion when            seated. The eyes tend to move into depression. This pattern            limits the ability to look ahead and to reach out in any            direction. By reducing the components of flexion in a            position or task the child is given the best opportunities to            use vision effectively. In standing visual stimuli or tasks            are designed to get the child to look ahead. Surfaces at            upper chest level or an easel are used for positioning, with            materials away from the chest to prevent eye depression. In            sitting, encourage moving the arms out to the side of the            body in ranges up to shoulder height, such as to a tilted            communication board placed on to the side of the wheelchair            tray. Avoid arm movements above shoulder height to the front            of the body as they increase flexor pull, e.g. the use of a            computer touch screen at eye level. Reposition visually            dependent tasks to shoulder height or below, using tilted            surfaces to reduce the need to use head flexion to see items            in close to the body. A head down position when lying on the            back over a wedge provides good visualization and arm            movement for activities at or above eye level (Geniale,            1991).</p>                <h3>Common Reflexes and Associated Reactions</h3>             Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex (ATNR): If this reflex            is present, when the head is turned to one side, changes in            muscle tone are seen in straightening of the limbs on the            face side and bending of limbs on the skull side, in a fencer            like posture. The eyes move toward the face side and elevate.            This is used by children functionally in attempts to reach            with the hand to one side. It can impair visual attention to            the flexed side and lower visual fields on the face side.            This reflex can be inhibited with head flexion (chin tucking)            or maintaining the head and upper extremity tasks closer to            midline.               <p>Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex (STNR):            When the head is flexed, bringing the chin to the chest,            there may be a corresponding bending( flexion) of the arms            and straightening (extension) of the legs. When the head is            lifted upward, the arms will straighten and the legs extend.            When a child is asked to look up at an object, they may use            this reflex to raise their head by straightening their arms.            It interferes with tasks like holding the head up to see a            computer monitor while using the arms in a flexed position            for keyboarding.</p>                <p>Associated Reactions: These are increases in            spasticity in the affected parts of the body during the use            of less affected body parts. These reactions are sometimes            observed in children with minimal neurological impairment as            well as severe spasticity, usually in distal body parts e.g.            hands, feet and eyes. So fisting of the more effected hand            may be seen when the other hand grasps a pen during writing.            Associated reactions interfere with the use of vision as they            cause an increase in ocular-motor problems, most commonly            strabismus. Modifying the task or positioning the person so            the task requires less effort and muscle tension can help            alleviate the associated reaction. Use of the child s own            visual skills in the task in patterns which inhibit increased            muscle tone also inhibits the reaction. So if the child is            influenced by flexor tone, elevating the writing activity on            a slanted desktop so their gaze is elevated away from their            body and supporting the more effected arm in an elevated,            weightbearing postion to the side will normalize tone,            decreasing associated reactions of strabismus and hand            flexion (Geniale, 1991).</p>               <br /> <br />                            <h2>TACTILE DYSFUNCTION IN THE NEUROLOGICALLY IMPAIRED            CLIENT</h2>             Intact reception of tactile input is required for the            communication modalities of Braille, tactile symbols and            touch/in-hand signing. These modalities are successfully used            with a varietyof visually impaired populations, however,            cannot be transferred to individuals with Cerebral Palsy and            visual impairnents without the following considerations:               <ul> <li>As the tactile system is so extensive and because it                 interacts with so many of the other sensory systems,                 damage to the nervous system as a whole often involves                 damage to the tactile system (Short-DeGraff, 1988).</li><li>Very little research has been reported on the                 tactile reception of children with the neuromotor                 dysfunction of C.P., however, atypical responses to                 tactile stimuli are noted. Hypersensitivity or                 hyposensitivity to tactile input or delayed or unusual                 responses to touch are observed in the C.P. population                 and documented more extensively in Sensory Integration                 research with less impaired individuals.(Fisher et al,                 1991)</li><li>The motor control to position the hand and move it                 over a Braille text may be limited, particularly for                 long term needs of accessing numerous lines/pages of                 text. The sensory receptors are most concentrated in the                 fingertips, however, hand control to isolate and use                 this body part functionally for Braille is frequently                 limited by abnormal muscle tone. Other body parts with                 fewer receptors for touch may not be sensitive enough to                 substitute,e.g. a fisted hand presents only the back of                 the fingers with fewer neuro-receptors for touch than                 the finger tips. Mouthing is frequently seen in children                 with impaired development of visual skills and manual                 manipulation skills, as the mouth area is rich in                 sensory receptors. Touching objects to the face near                 thelips can become a habitual way of gathering tactile                 information about an object. Habitual mouthing would                 therefore indicate under developed tactile reception                 and/or manipulation skills in the hands (Goold &amp;                 Hummell, 1993).</li><li>The development of the tactile system is affected if                 tactile input is limited and motor response comprimised,                 as the perception of sensation interacts with motor                 response(DeGangi.1994).</li> </ul>             An interdiciplinary team evaluation of the client&#39;s ability            to use tactile input for touchcommunication, tactile symbols            or Braille is recommended for clients with multiple            impairments.               <h2>VISUAL AND PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF ACCESSING AUGMENTATIVE            COMMUNICATION AIDS/COMPUTERS</h2>             The visual demands of direct selection with a finger/thumb or            a control extender such as a mouth stick to an interface such            as a regular or miniature keyboard or membrane surface, (with            or without keyguard) necessitates:               <ul class="noindent"> <li>adequate acuity to match range of reach and screen                 position</li><li>intact visual fields for area in which interface can                 be positioned</li><li>oculomotor skills for focusing on interface,                 scanning for selection, gaze shift and fixation on                 screen if needed and</li><li>cortical visual skills for interpretation of                 symbols/letters and interpreting the screen                 activity.</li> </ul>                <p>Direct selection with larger body site (e.g. fist/foot)            for an enlarged keyboard or programable interface also            requires:</p>                <ul> <li>adequate acuity to match the larger range of reach,                 distance to screen and</li><li>requires intact visual fields for area in which the                 interface can be positioned.
