Traditional methods of exchanging             information are highly dependent on both the sender\'s and             receiver\'s ability to hear, see, manipulate objects and get             about campuses. An ever increasing amount of information             exchange on campus is computer mediated. Because many             accomodations for students with print impairments or other             disabilities are computer based, this trend can make the             educational process more accessible.                  <p>Some computer mediated exchanges, by their very nature,             are more accessible. For example, tutorials using an             electronic bulletin board can provide equal access to             students who are deaf or students who are non-speaking. Some             information exchange is more accessible because compatible             alternative-computer-access systems have been developed. Thus             class reference materials on disk can be read by a student             who is blind using a screen reader, without the need for a             scanner and optical character recognition program.</p>                  <p>Unfortunately the development of alternative access             systems frequently lags far behind mainstream technology             innovations. For this reason the latest trends in computer             mediated education, (e.g., transmission of multimedia, video             conferencing, and shared computer workspace) may be just as             inaccessible as traditional teaching methods. However,             because the computer offers flexibility in terms of input,             output and processing of information it can be argued that             putting the information in computer readable form is one step             to making it accessible to students who require alternative             input methods, translated or reprocessed information or             alternative output modes.</p>                  <p>Whether positive or negative from an equal access             perspective, the shift in teaching tools and methods of             information exchange demands a profound shift in the types of             accommodations required by students with disabilities.             Opinions, preferences, policies and guidelines on computer             mediated communication in higher education are largely             unformed. This is a good time to advocate for integrated             accommodations for all users. In order to effectively             contribute to the reshaping of the campus those interested in             accessible higher education must be well informed about the             range of new technologies, as well as any barriers to             participation and possible methods of overcoming the             barriers.</p>                  <p>One area yet to be negotiated is the extent to which             accommodations or access features will be incorporated in the             information technology itself rather than in the student\'s             personal access system. Frequently accommodations for             students with disabilities have benefits for students and             faculty as a whole. Displaying information in more than one             mode constitutes good teaching practice, not just special             accommodation. Captioning can serve as a method of             record-keeping. Choosing a multiple window video-conferencing             system which can display text as well as video has advantages             for more than the student with a hearing impairment.</p>                  <p>Universities are centers of research and development.             Strong advocacy for inclusion will heighten the awareness of             the university community to the challenges faced by students             with disabilities. This is bound to result in the dedication             of greater expertise and resources to meeting the             challenges.</p>                 <br /> <br /> <a name="#incentives"></a><h3>Incentives for Computer-Mediated Information Exchange</h3>              Although computer mediated education is unlikely to take over             traditional teaching, there are a number of incentives, quite             apart from the access benefits, which make it attractive to             institutions of higher learning. These include:                                               Pedagogy:These is a shift in learning theory which encourages                  cooperative learning coupled with learner directed                  education. A networked computer environment is conducive                  to these processes. Through computer mediated                  instruction it is also easier to address the different                  learning styles of the students. Students are given the                  flexibility to learn at their own pace.Economics:A larger amount of information can be transmitted                  over a computer network, to a larger group of learners,                  and with a smaller time investment, than through                  traditional means.Convenience:On-line interaction need not be dictated by time and                  location.Speed:It is far faster to send e-mail to a colleague than                  to print out a memo and send it via campus mail, or to                  send an assignment to the entire class via e-mail than                  to photocopy and handout multiple copies during                  class.               Related to all of the above is the issue of distance             education. Universities are recognizing their responsibility             to accommodate the &quot; new majority&quot; student which includes             students in remote areas or mature students who may be             employed (not to mention the economic benefits). Computer             mediated education is a natural media.             <br /> <br /> <a name="#disincentives"></a><h3>Disincentives</h3>                                          No transition escapes negative repercussions or             disincentives. Computer mediated information exchange             requires physical, economic and cultural access to a computer             system. Those without any one of these may be excluded. As             computers become less expensive, easier to use and a more             customary part of our culture, these effects will lessen.                  <p>It can also be argued that computer mediated communication             lessens human contact and increases isolation. Others would             argue that it opens additional channels of interaction             thereby decreasing isolation.</p>                  <p>Some students have difficulty communicating and learning             through writing. Use of multimedia may accommodate the needs             of this group of students.</p>                  <p>Students with disabilities may feel compelled to enroll in             classes which offer computer mediated instruction rather than             pursuing their personal interests. The prevalence of computer             mediated instruction and information exchange may also reduce             pressure to provide other accommodations. Both of these risks             highlight the need to offer all students a range of feasible             choices.</p>                 <br /> <br /> <a name="#infoex"></a><h3>What information exchange has become computer             mediated?</h3>                                          Many Universities provide the option of performing             administrative tasks over a computer network or modem. These             tasks include obtaining information about course             availability, registering for courses, changing courses or             updating university records. This is much more convenient for             all students than standing in line and running from one             office to another during prescribed office hours. It has             obvious advantages for a student with a mobility, visual or             hearing impairment.                 <p>Many libraries are now offering a large range of titles in             electronic text form, whether over a network or on CD ROM.             Electronically searching for information in a reference             publication can be far faster than manually searching.             Libraries are also assisting researchers in learning to use             the Internet and remote databases to obtain information.</p>                  <p>Some text book stores are using document on demand systems             to produce both custom course packs and standard texts. The             documents are produced by scanning in hardcopy from various             sources, combining it with electronic files provided by the             instructor, organizing the material and printing it on a             DocuTech printer when requested by a customer. The documents             are in TIFF format before being printed. Processing these             files using an optical character recognition program would             require minimal additional effort and provide e-text files             for students with print impairments and faculty who wish to             further edit their course paks.</p>                  <p>A larger number of instructors are experimenting with             fully networked, virtual or on-line classes. Students log             into the class either from a computer at home, a remote             satellite class, or a public terminal site at the university.             These classes or seminars may be conducted in real time or as             topic specific electronic conferences where messages are             exchanged within a much larger time frame. Edward Barret             describes these classes as &quot; a \'virtual\' space that exists             not only within four walls during scheduled class time but             also outside those limits, to be invoked anytime, anywhere,             by any class member, to suit his or her educational needs.&quot;             Lectures or seminars are delivered, class discussion is             conducted, assignments are given and handed in and readings             and course materials are handed out over the network.             Frequently these classes are used to share and critique             student compositions or to cooperatively produce student             work. The classes can tap into the vast resources of the             Internet, resourcing experts from around the world and             hosting &quot; guest speakers&quot; who would not be available to talk             to traditional classes. Studies have found that these classes             encourage much more democratic interchange. A much larger             proportion of students participate. Because time constraints             are de-emphasized many more communicative turns are taken and             topics are explored more thoroughly. Outside resources or             information necessary to the discussion can be accessed             during the class. Class members who are shy or unassertive             are more likely to participate. Frequently tutorials are             conducted in the same manner. If all information exchanged is             in electronic-text form students who are hearing impaired or             speech impaired can usually participate on an equal basis.             Classes are also easier to &quot; get to&quot; for students with             mobility impairments.</p>                  <p>Extra-curricular campus activities are also occurring over             networks or bulletin boards. Thus chess clubs, political             lobby groups, student councils, or debate clubs frequently             conduct their business over a computer network.</p>                 <br /> <br /> <a name="#accissues"></a><h3>What are the access issues with computer mediated             information exchange?</h3>                                          Computer-mediated information exchange can be very roughly             divided into three categories: 1) electronic text; 2)             multi-media and graphical user interfaces; and 3) the loose             grouping of realtime, video conferencing, shared computer             workspaces and 3D virtual reality interfaces. Each category             presents a different set of access issues and requires a             different set of accommodations.             <br /> <br /> <a name="#text"></a><h3>Electronic Text</h3>                                          Presently exchanges of electronic text are the most             accessible. Alternative methods of entering, manipulating and             translating text to audio or large print are well worked out             and readily available. Three issues remain: file format             compatibility, compatibility of alternative access systems             with the information technology used and copyright issues.             Numerous papers and resources address the issues of             accessible computer labs or public terminals and             software/hardware compatibility. The issue of copyright needs             to be addressed by the entire e-text market. The perspective             of consumers with print impairments needs to be included in             the negotiations. The intricacies of copyright issues related             to e-text are beyond the scope of this paper.                 <p>Efforts are underway to address the issue of compatible             file formats. Each platform (MacIntosh vs. IBM vs. UNIX) or             application program (Word Perfect vs. Microsoft Word)             produces and reads it\'s own file format. When files are taken             to their lowest common denominator, namely ASCII, they can be             imported to most application programs but all of the             structural information is stripped out. Several groups are             pushing for standardized methods of specifying the non-text             information in a file. One popular standard is SGML or             Standard Generalized Markup Language. SGML prescribes a             standard set of markup tags to specify the structure versus             the content of a document. ICADD or the International             Committee on Accessible Document Design has designed a set of             markup tags which provide additional information required by             people who are print impaired. SGML and the ICADD DTD (Data             tag template) are yet to be widely used by electronic             information providers or interpreted by alternative access             systems. If this standard is adopted it will address issues             of file format incompatibility.</p>                 <br /> <br /> <a name="#mm"></a><h3>Multimedia</h3>                                          Graphical user interfaces, while making the computer             interface more natural and accessible for the general user,             make it less accessible for students who cannot use visual             information and students who cannot control pointing devices             or who access the computer using indirect access methods             (scanning, Morse code). Multimedia introduces sounds and             images inaccessible to students with visual or hearing             impairments.                 <p>A larger proportion of communications and educational             software uses a graphical user interface and includes             multimedia. Access barriers presented by this type of             interface include the following.</p>                  <ul> <li>A large amount of information is graphically or                  visually presented.</li><li>There is no consistent screen architecture or                  logical sequencing of items on a screen, making it                  difficult to predict where to direct attention.</li><li>Information is presented simultaneously making it                  difficult to interpret using Braille or speech or access                  using scanning, which are all highly serial.</li><li>GUI\'s require emulation of the mouse as well as the                  keyboard.</li><li>Tones, sounds and speech are used to convey critical                  information.</li> </ul>              Work is underway by several groups who are investigating             access to graphical user interfaces and multimedia. These             include the Trace Centre in Wisconsin, the European Project             on Access to Graphical User Interfaces by Blind People, in             Europe and the Hugh MacMillan Rehabilitation Centre, among             others. The International Committee on Accessible Document             Design has taken on the task of producing standards for             multimedia.                 <p>The message to software/hardware designers, instructors             and those making purchasing decisions is:</p>                  <ul class="noindent"> <li>All information should be presented in several                  modes. Thus all audio should be captioned or duplicated                  visually. All visually displayed information such as                  video, graphics or icons should be duplicated or                  described using speech or text.</li><li>There should be keyboard equivalents for all                  pointing device inputs.</li><li>Interface standards should be adhered to to insure                  that alternative access systems are compatible.</li> </ul>              Interfaces are presently under development which will give             students who are blind access to spatial and essentially             pictographic information. These include 2D audio displays,             haptic displays and tactile displays.             <br /> <br /> <a name="#vidcon"></a><h3>Video Conferencing, Shared Computer Workspaces and 3D             Virtual Reality Interfaces</h3>                                          The access challenges presented by the third type of computer             mediated information exchange require the most creative             solutions. Access to this type of interface is made difficult             by the fact that information is transmitted in real time,             depends upon all senses and is largely unpredictable. Thus             accommodations must be provided in real time. At present this             means real-time audio captioning and video description.             Accommodations which can be provided by the system rather             than a human intervener include:                 <ul> <li>The capability to use replacement gestures for all                  gestural inputs.</li><li>Modal redundancy for all computer generated feedback                  (e.g., 2D or 3D tones to duplicate lines drawn on a                  electronic blackboard, tactile feedback as well as                  visual feedback in VR systems).</li><li>Multiple windows to display predictable text such as                  outlines, or agendas as well as video and real-time                  captioning.</li> </ul>              Two technologies which are still in the experimental or even             conceptual stage may offer greater access in the future. The             first is speaker independent, continuous speech recognition             and transcription. Numerous market forces which have nothing             to do with equal access are motivating this development.                 <p>Computer based interpretation of video is the second.             Video processing technology has been used for feature             detection and gesture recognition in other applications. This             same technology could be used to make visual information             transmitted through video conferencing available to people             who are blind or sight impaired. Thus the system can be             trained to recognize when someone walks into the room, raises             their hand, smiles, frowns, makes nervous movements with             their hands, nods or shakes their head, looks away etc. A             protocol could be set up whereby at the beginning of each             session participants raise their hand and say their name.             Participants would then be &quot; tagged&quot; by the system. A digital             tablet could be used to selectively &quot; look&quot; at each             participant by moving a hand over their location. Feedback             could be spoken or communicated through various user             specified sounds, tones or music. This may be preferable to             spoken feedback as it demands or prompts a lower level of             awareness and therefore more closely mimics the             non-linguistic communicative signals it is translating.</p>                 <br /> <br /> <a name="#newacc"></a><h3>New Accommodations in Higher Education</h3>                                          In order to make the electronic campus more accessible a             number of services and tasks must be performed. These include             the following.                  Current Information Directory:Students, staff and faculty require assistance in                  finding, keeping current and navigating through                  information related to access. This information would                  include listings of texts or course materials available                  in accessible formats, media used in courses, available                  alternative access systems, accessible computer labs or                  public terminals, extra-curricular bulletin boards or                  listserves, and available resources or accessible                  information sources.Policy and Guidelines for Purchasing:The university must be assisted in making decisions                  which do not adversely affect staff, students and                  faculty who have disabilities. To this end clear                  information and guidelines must be made available and                  presented to the decision makers.Education:Courses should be available to faculty on how to                  provide course material in e-text form and how to                  provide accessible instruction. Computer users with                  disabilities should be given instruction in how to                  access computer mediated information exchange, including                  e-text, the Internet and computer mediated                  instruction.               Wherever possible these services should be integrated with             related services provided to the general university             population.             <br /> <br /> <a name="#conc"></a><h3>Conclusion</h3>                                          More and more tasks on the university campus are becoming             computer mediated. This shift significantly effects students             who use alternative formats and students with mobility or             speech impairments. Individuals concerned with equal access             must be prepared for the changing needs so that can we insure             that accessibility is considered in the electronic             reconstruction of the university campus?             <br /> <br /> <a name="#ref"></a><h3>References</h3>                                          Barrett, Edward, 1993.
