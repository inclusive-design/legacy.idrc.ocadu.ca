		                   Laurie Harrison, Jan Richards and Jutta Treviranus                   <br />                     Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University of                   Toronto                   <br /> <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc">http://idrc.ocad.ca</a><br />                                            <p>Today&#39;s educators face a new challenge in meeting the              demand for accessible online learning resources. For reasons              of pedagogy, economics, access and efficiency, an              exponentially increasing amount of teaching and learning is              occurring over computer networks. Networks such as the Web,              Intranets or dedicated broad band networks are being used to              teach, to conduct research, to hold tutorials, to submit              assignments and to act as libraries. Learners of all ages,              from preschool, through university, professional upgrading,              employment training and life long learning are participating              in educational programs delivered over computer networks.              This move to online learning provides new possibilities for              students with disabilities, who benefit from the inherent              flexibility of access to learning materials now available in              electronic media.              <br />               Advocates of accessible online learning have identified              several key areas of benefit:              <br />               </p>                    <ol> <li>Web-based delivery of distance education provides a                   critical opportunity for accommodation of students with                   special needs because of the fact that learning                   materials can easily be adapted to varying learning                   styles, rates, and communication formats.</li><li>Materials can be quickly prepared for use with                   adaptive computer technology, and once they are in an                   online formats, can be presented in redundant,                   reinforcing or alternative formats (e.g., speech, print                   or graphics).</li><li>The wealth of resources on the Web can be used to                   augment existing curriculum through access to current,                   recently published learning materials.</li><li>Accessible Internet-based communication tools                   provide learners with the opportunity to interact more                   easily with peers and instructors.</li><li>Online distance education may allow students to                   continue to participate in learning activities when they                   are not able to attend classes in person or on                   campus.</li> </ol>                    <p>However, in order for us to exploit the potential benefits              of online education, the resources must be developed in Web              formats which are accessible to students who use adaptive              technology. To this end, it is essential that educators and              administrators are provided with tools and resources to              support them in the following aspects of digitized curriculum              development:</p>                    <ol> <li>Automating Validation of Accessible Web Pages                   - Tools must be provided to ensure that HTML markup is                   in compliance with WAI (Web Accessibility Innitiative)                   guidelines.</li><li>Accessible Courseware -Courseware utilities                   and communication tools must have accessible user                   interface.</li><li>Accessible Curriculum Formats -Interactive                   components and multimedia elements must be presented in                   accessible formats.</li> </ol>                    <p>While adaptive technology does allow the learner to              control mode of input/output, and customize their interface,              authoring tools are the logical place to lay the foundation              for universal design. Rather than retrofitting or finding              &quot;work-arounds&quot; to allow access by students with disabilities,              educators and Web authors are encouraged to create materials              using inherently accessible standards and formats. The ATRC              (Adaptive Technology Resource Centre), University of Toronto,              has undertaken several research projects to review tools              currently on the market and identify utilities and techniques              that facilitate development of accessible online learning              materials, as described below.</p>                    <h2>1. Automating Validation of Accessible Web Pages</h2>                    <p>The fundamental building blocks of online learning              resources are Web pages. Whether you are providing text-based              content, images, media components or interactive tools, they              are generally accessed through a user interface written in              HTML. In the case of curriculum design, we are delivering              education, to diverse learners, with diverse needs. To be              effective, we will need to make certain that pages remain              usable to the widest possible range of users, who have varied              technologies, techniques and situations:</p>                    <ul> <li>Learners may be trying to access your pages using                   specialized software that adapts the content for                   non-visual access, text-only browsing or other                   customized formats.</li><li>Learners may be using various types of hardware                   including devices without mice, with small, low                   resolution, or black and white screens, etc.</li><li>Learners may have cognitive disabilities, learning                   disabilities or other differences that affect their                   learning needs.</li> </ul>                    <p>With so many variables, where does one begin? The Web              Accessibility Iniative (WAI), a sub-committee of the World              Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is the present leader in              establishing accessibility guidelines for page authoring. The              WAI is coordinating many organizations that have produced Web              accessibility reference documents in the past, in order to              develop a comprehensive and unified set of accessibility              recommendations. The most current version of the guidelines              may be found at the World Wide Web Consortium site,<a href="http://www.w3c.org/wai">http://www.w3c.org/wai</a></p>                    <p>In addition to being familiar with the guidelines,              educational resource developers will want to make use of              validation tools such as the W3C&#39;s own HTML Validation              Service (<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org</a>)              and Bobby (<a href="http://www.cast.org/bobby">http://www.cast.org/bobby</a>)              from the Centre for Applied Special Technology. Both of these              tools will validate Web pages, providing a summary of              potential concerns, with links to information on the specific              issues identified. While the automation of the validation              process is key to ensuring accessible design, further gains              are possible if the validation utilities are integrated into              authoring tools, and support the designer beyond              identification of potential problems, by correcting or              repairing the of potential barriers to access as well.</p>                    <h3>The A-Prompt Toolkit</h3>                    <p>The ATRC, as part of the Network for Inclusive Distance              Education (NIDE) has developed the A-Prompt Toolkit, an              authoring support utility that evaluates HTML code and, in              addition, offers a repair function. A-Prompt is currently              available as a Microsoft Windows software module (DLL),              designed with the goal of integration into existing authoring              and courseware tools in mind.              <br />                Currently, the A-Prompt Toolkit may be used in two ways:</p>                    <ul> <li>A stand-alone program. In this mode, the user                   selects files that will be checked for accessibility                   problems. If any problems are detected, A-Prompt will                   display dialogs and guide the user to fix the problem.                   The repaired file can then be saved.</li><li>Integrated into the HTML Authoring Tool. In                   this method the authoring tool sends HTML code to                   A-Prompt for validation and repair. The HTML text can be                   sent to A-Prompt as it is entered by the user or when                   the entire web page is complete. If an accessibility                   problem is detected, A-Prompt displays the necessary                   dialogs and guides the user to fix the problem. The                   repaired HTML code is returned to the host program where                   it is inserted into the document.</li> </ul>                    <p>A-Prompt checks for accessibility problems based on the              WAI Page Authoring Guidelines. While the ATRC in the process              of pursuing partnerships with authoring tool developers, the              A-Prompt toolkit is now available as a free, downloadable              utility, at <a href="http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/">http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca</a>.</p>                    <h2>2. Accessible Courseware</h2>                    <p>The exponentially increasing number of educational courses              being offered over the Web has spurred a growing industry of              software tools to assist in creation of Web-based curriculum              and in performing class management tasks. Recent courseware              development tools assist educators in creating and              distributing new, customized curriculum materials quickly and              easily using the Web as a vehicle for delivery.</p>                    <p>Courseware products such as WebCT, TopClass, CourseInfo,              Virtual-U and other programs will take HTML documents, along              with other media and resources, and quickly organize them              into a framework specifically designed for delivery of              Web-based courses and other learning resources. Frequently              they are used to complement traditional lecture-based              programs.</p>                    <p>Courseware products are helpful to educators who are              unfamiliar with programming, allowing easy integration of              password protection, interactive activities, tracking of              student progress, etc. Overall, the interface is fairly              simple for the designer, as many use templates and wizards              extensively to assist in course content creation.              Step-by-step guides support creation of a range of              components, from the course home page, to bulletin boards, to              quizzes and marking systems.</p>                    <p>While this approach is and efficient for course designers,              the automation reduces control of the final formatting of the              HTML pages rendered. Thus, while education programs built on              courseware platforms could easily facilitate access to              education for students with disabilities, they frequently              present access barriers to users of certain types of adaptive              technology. Ironically, very few include basic accessibility              considerations outlined in the WAI guidelines, potentially              excluding those individuals who stand to benefit most from              new technologies. Care must be taken to choose products              carefully, and be attentive to potential barriers. While the              creation of course materials is automated by these tools, the              compliance with accessibility standards is not.</p>                    <h3>Courseware Reviews</h3>                    <p>In order to encourage courseware developers to become more              aware of accessibility issues, the Adaptive Technology              Resource Centre continues to conduct reviews of products              currently available on the market. In 1999 we conducted at              study evaluating leading courseware packages, using overall              functionality in relation to accessibility as critieria for              an accessibility ranking . The results of this study are              available at <a href="http://snow.utoronto.ca/initiatives/crseval/crseval.html">http://snow.utoronto.ca/initiatives/crseval/crseval.html</a>.</p>                    <p>Results of the 1999 evaluation showed Lotus Learning as              having the highest accessibility score at that time, although              it should be observed that significant issues remained, such              as missing ALT text and use of frames. Web Course in a Box              and TopClass ranked well, although with less functionality.              Results of this study highlighted the fact that all of these              courseware developers have a considerable distance to travel              in terms of providing tools to create accessible learning              environments. Although courseware product developers such as              Lotus, WebCT and CourseInfo are taking steps to improve              accessibility, in response to the US Rehabilitation Act,              Section 508, there are at present no commerical products on              the market which adequately address accessibility issues.</p>                    <p>Currently the ATRC is undertaking a second more              comprehensive phase of this research, investigating the most              recent releases of these courseware packages. Results will be              available in fall of 2000.</p>                    <p>The designer/instructor is often left with the task of              finding &quot;workarounds&quot; or developing alternative access              methods in order to accommodate users of adaptive technology.              The following are some strategies for ensuring access to your              educational courseware.</p>                    <ul> <li>Create pages externally and upload to the courseware                   platform:                   <br />                    When selecting your courseware development tool, choose                   a program which allows creation of content pages in your                   HTML editor of choice, then requires them to be uploaded                   to the course. This will allow you to incorporate                   accessibility features which templates or wizards used                   by the courseware do not include.</li><li>Build a site map:                   <br />                    A site map which is a simple text-based table of                   contents for the course site will guarantee                   accessibility of the navigation system. If the program                   you are using does not provide this feature, you can                   build one yourself, and link it to the home page of the                   course.</li><li>Build alternative communication tools:                   <br />                    If tools such as bulletin boards or chat utilities are                   not accessible, you may need to adapt by constructing                   tools external to the course software until such time as                   the courseware developer is able to provide them.</li> </ul>                    <h2>3. Accessible Curriculum Formats</h2>                    <p>While accessible HTML standards have received considerable              attention in recent years, there is as yet no vehicle for              delivering accessible math, science or music notation. As              well, interactive courseware and scientific simulation              completely generally excludes students who are blind or who              cannot use a mouse, and most synchronous communication tools              are completely inaccessible.</p>                    <p>To facilitate progress in this area, a number of              innovative strategies are being developed by the Network for              Inclusive Distance Education, a consortium of organizations              collaborating to develop new access standards and strategies              for online education. The mandate of this network is to make              it possible for learners with disabilities to participate              fully in network delivered education opportunities. In              addtition to the previously discussed A-Prompt Toolkit, NIDE              is undertaking the following research and development              initiatives:</p>                    <h3>Science and Math Notation</h3>                    <p>Math, science and music notation is presently transmitted              over the Web in graphic formats (PDF, GIF, etc.). For people              without disabilities this means that the algorithms or              equations cannot be edited. For people who use screen              readers, refreshable Braille displays or text to speech              systems, this means that the information cannot be read or              edited.</p>                    <p>All alternative display systems used by people with              sensory impairments or learning disabilities read and              translate only electronic text. Thus text transmitted in a              graphic format such as PDF, is completely inaccessible.              Science, engineering, math and music curriculum transmitted              over the Web is inaccessible to people using alternative              displays. This is a critical problem as math, engineering and              science are targeted growth sectors in the Ontario              economy.</p>                    <p>There is an emerging standard for publishing, and              rendering math and science notation on the Web. MathML 1.0,              cast as an application of XML, was released as a W3C              Recommendation on the 7th April 1998. MathML is a low-level              specification for describing mathematics as a basis for              machine to machine communication. It provides a much needed              foundation for the inclusion of mathematical expressions in              Web pages.</p>                    <p>At present, several developers are offering pluggins,              translators and equation editors which can generate HTML              pages where the math expressions are represented directly in              MathML. NIDE is testing the output of these various products              to assess the potential for integration into authoring              utilities previously described. Of particular interest is the              iMath initiative, a consortium developing a editor and              browser program that will allow editing and viewing of              MathMl.</p>                    <p>Our goal is create MathML setup and profile utilities for              popular alternative access systems, such as screen readers,              refreshable Braille displays that support the Nemeth code              (the Braille standard for science and math notation) and              speech recognition systems. This will allow individuals who              are blind, visually impaired, learning disabled or physically              disabled to read and edit science and math notation over the              Web.</p>                    <h3>Music Notation</h3>                    <p>NIDE is currently exploring popular file formats for music              notation distribution standards. This includes the NIFF              (Notation Interchange File Format) was completed in the fall              of 1995. This is a standard digital format for the              representation of standard musical notation. The format is              very flexible, allowing for simple implementations with              minimal graphical information, or much more elaborate              descriptions including all aspects of page layout, associated              midi data, custom symbols, etc. The NIFF Consortium has also              developed at freely available SDK for software developers              implementing NIFF.</p>               Another popular file format developed by the CERL research              group, at the University of Illinois, is an extensible music              notation format called TILIA. The CERL group have also              created a notation editor available in the public domain              called LIME. LIME includes a NIFF import, export utility. A              US based corporation named Dancing Dots have developed a              utility that translates TILIA and NIFF files into Braille              notation. <br />                                      <p>The NIDE project is investigating the feasibility of              integrating the LIME editor and Dancing Dot utility into the              courseware authoring modules, to allow the creation of              accessible music curriculum by educators.</p>                    <p>As well, we are working with Learn Ontario to develop a              database that will allow the user to access information about              a piece of music in various formats. This design is              targetting seniors, and will allow them to retrieve or              contribute lyrics, notation, or audio snippets for a              particular piece.</p>                    <h2>Accessible Interactive Courseware and Educational              Simulation</h2>                    <p>Interactive courseware and simulations are predominantly              delivered over the Web using either Javascript, Java Applets,              Dreamweaver, Authorware Players, or Perl script. Screen              readers are not able to extract text from the above              mechanisms. People who are unable to use a mouse are              frequently restricted from using this material as it requires              mouse control. Simulations that cannot be translated and              annotated verbally or in text form are not accessible to              learners who are blind.</p>                    <p>The NIDE project is addressing these barriers by exploring              strategies for expanding and improving the modalities that              can be used to display and control interactive and simulation              courseware over the Web:</p>                    <p>In collaboration with SUN, the ATRC has developed an Audio              Look and Feel that allows the user to sonify a Java-based              graphical user interface (GUI), displaying all interface              components through sound or speech as well as visually. The              Audio Look and Feel will be integrated into the courseware              authoring modules.</p>                    <p>The project is also developing applications that support              use of VRML and haptic interfaces over the web. ATRC in              partnership with Haptic Technologies Inc. have made it              possible to both transmit and render tactile or haptic              feedback using the Web. NIDE is currently developing a haptic              periodic table of the elements, and also a haptic graphing              tool.</p>                    <p>NIDE is working with software developers to create more              accessible interactive science programs. Two software              programs targeted are the Digital Frog suite of science              exploration activities and the Electric Chemistry lab from              Snowbird software.</p>                    <h2>Accessible Synchronous Communication Tools</h2>                    <p>Synchronous communication tools, because they most closely              mimic traditional communication methods, present traditional              access challenges. Fortunately, because communication is              computer mediated, we can exploit the translation and              transformation capabilities of computers to create new access              solutions. The NIDE project is exploring solutions to access              challenges presented by synchronous learning tools such as              real-time chat rooms, IRC, ICQ, etc.) and is continue to              develop, apply and evaluate access solutions such as voice              recognition, pattern recognition, word prediction.</p>                    <p>These tools are geared towards enhancing communication              between students and teachers in a Web-based environment. A              database logs all of the communication, and allows queries,              organization and knowledge building through this interface              design.</p>                    <h2>Summary</h2>                    <p>Access to education has long been considered a basic human              right, and, as an ideal, has been recognized in the policies              set by institutions of higher learning. Our task is to ensure              that the ideal becomes a reality, as we move into the new              environment of online learning. A grassroots approach,              beginning with authoring tools, will mean that accessible              design becomes the status quo, rather than an additional              effort undertaken by designers who have awareness of the              potential problems.</p>                    <h2>Additonal Web Resources</h2>                    <ul> <li>Adaptive Technology Resource Centre                   <br />     <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc">http://idrc.ocad.ca</a>                   </li><li>A-Prompt Toolkit                   <br />     <a href="http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/">http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca</a>                   </li><li><a href="../../../../index.php%3Foption=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=173&amp;Itemid=69.html">Adding Feeling, Audio and Equal Access to Distance                   Education</a>                    <br /></li><li>Accessible Synchronous Communication Tools                   <br />     <a href="http://nide.snow.utoronto.ca/SyncComm/index.htm">http://nide.snow.utoronto.ca/SyncComm/index.htm</a>                   </li><li>Digital Frog                   <br />     <a href="http://www.digitalfrog.com/">http://www.digitalfrog.com/</a>                   </li><li>Snowbird                   <br />                    </li><li>                        Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)                        <br />     <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>                                                        <ul><li>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0                             <br />         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>                              </li><li>Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines                             1.0                             <br />         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS/</a>                             </li><li>                                  Techniques For Evaluation And                                  Implementation Of Web Content                                  <br />         <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/</a>                                  </li></ul></li> </ul> 	</div>
