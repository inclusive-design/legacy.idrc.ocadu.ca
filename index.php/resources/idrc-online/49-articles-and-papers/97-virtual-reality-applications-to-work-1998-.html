With the aid of specially designed            transducers and sensors, users interact with displayed            images, moving and manipulating virtual objects, and            performing other actions in a way that engenders a feeling of            actual presence (immersion) in the simulated environment. The            unique features and flexibility of VR give it extraordinary            potential for use in work-related applications. It permits            users to experience and interact with a life-like model or            environment, in safety and at convenient times, while            providing a degree of control over the simulation that is            usually not possible in the real-life situation. The            work-related applications that appear to be most promising            are those that employ virtual reality for visualization and            representation, distance communication and education,            hands-on training, and orientation and navigation. This            article presents an overview to the concepts of VR focusing            on its applications in a variety of work settings. Issues            related to potential difficulties in using VR including side            effects and the transfer of skills learned in the virtual            environment to the real world are also reviewed. The article            concludes with a brief discussion of work-related            developments that are expected to take place within the next            five years.</p>                <p>Keywords: Virtual reality, Virtual environments,            Transfer, Side effects, Computer simulation, Immersion.</p>                <p>Imagine the following scenario. The city            planners and inspectors want to explore your company&Iacute;s            new urban shopping development, to help them complete their            environmental impact assessment before construction begins.            As Assistant Project Manager, you have arranged a tour of a            computer-simulated prototype.</p>                <p>You walk into your office, sit down at a table,            and turn on the Dome. A large image projected on the wall            extends the table &quot;through the screen.&quot; The other            participants are already there, each represented around the            table by an animated figure, a virtual human that presents            the appropriate gestures, facial expressions and body            language of the actual participant.</p>                <p>You hear a familiar voice behind you. Turning            around, you are pleased to see that the chief            architect&Iacute;s image has just arrived. It&Iacute;s            already evening at her office in Tokyo, so you hadn&Iacute;t            expected her to attend. You&Iacute;ve never met her in            person, only via these immersive company meetings. She speaks            with a British accent. You wonder whether you are hearing her            directly, or through an automatic translator.</p>                <p>After the usual greetings and preliminaries,            the group takes a virtual walk-through of the proposed mall,            the sounds of your footsteps reverberating through the            spacious, brightly lit virtual corridors. The city planners            seem impressed with the layout, and you decide to take them            on a simulated drive-through around the perimeter. You step            into the underground parking garage, and together you assume            seats in the virtual car. Unfortunately, as you are pulling            out of the garage, one of the inspectors notices that there            are only two fire escapes. He browses the building code on            his PC and projects the relevant information on the garage            wall to the left. Shamefaced at forgetting such an obvious            requirement, you quickly begin to sketch in a third exit-way,            the computer vision system tracking your hand movements as            they move through the air. The faces of the other figures            register impatience, with only the architect sending a            private word of encouragement. The addition completed, you            open the door to the new stairwell and lead them through it            to the outside, the architect complimenting you on your            choice of tiles. The city planners are clearly pleased with            the outdoor landscaping, particularly the water-park, one            enthusiastic official even donning his cyberglove to feel the            cool water. A few more on-the-spot alterations are made to            the height of the southern wing when it was observed to block            the view of a historic landmark, and then the project was            approved for immediate construction. As you say goodbye and            close the Dome, you call up your boss to tell him the good            news, and begin preparing for this afternoon&Iacute;s meeting            with the team in Brazil.</p>                <p>Although this scenario may seem highly speculative, the            features described are already being tested and implemented            individually. It gives some idea of the work-related            possibilities offered by what is popularly known as &quot;virtual            reality.&quot; This paper details some of the applications            envisioned for this new technology, attempting to present a            realistic appraisal of its potential application to work            settings.</p>                <h2>What is Virtual Reality?</h2>                <p>Virtual reality (VR) entails the use of advanced            technologies, including computers and various multimedia            peripherals, to produce a simulated (i.e., virtual)            environment that users perceive as comparable to real world            objects and events. With the aid of specially designed            transducers and sensors, users interact with displayed            images, moving and manipulating virtual objects, and            performing other actions in a way that engenders a feeling of            actual presence in the simulated environment (see figure).            This is accomplished by having the simulation adjust to            movements of the user&Iacute;s body, so that the sensory cues            always correspond to what users would expect were they            performing the action in the real world. For example, the            software ensures that the visual scene is always appropriate            to the particular direction in which the user happens to be            looking. Visual feedback is often supplemented by auditory            cues that appear to remain in particular locations            independent of changes in head position and the presentation            of appropriately timed haptic, proprioceptive and vestibular            information.</p>                <p>Despite the fact that virtual reality has greatly changed            the way in which people are able to interact with and            manipulate information, the technology is, in fact, an            outgrowth of earlier generations of computing, and some of            its core components have been in use for some time. It is a            natural outcome of the continued development of computer            technology, including the availability of larger random            access memory (RAM), faster processing speed, higher capacity            storage media, diverse input interfaces, assorted multimedia            peripherals such as digital cameras, sound and graphics cards            and high speed CD-ROMs , and a burgeoning software industry            that is scrambling to develop more realistic 3-D            applications.</p>                <p>One of the cardinal features of virtual reality is the            provision of a sense of actual presence in and control over            the simulated environment. This feature is achieved to            greater or lesser extents in the various applications of            virtual reality, depending upon the goals of the particular            application and the cost and technical complexity its            developers are willing and able to assume. In the most            technically advanced applications of virtual reality, known            as &quot;immersive&quot; VR, the user is essentially isolated from the            outside world and fully enveloped within the            computer-generated environment. Multimedia peripherals such            as visual display units and speakers are integrated into a            helmet worn by the user, presenting stimuli appropriate to            the simulated setting. At the same time, the system tracks            the user&Iacute;s responses to the stimuli from the virtual            environment via position and force sensors mounted to the            helmet and a hand-held control device, data glove and/or body            suit, and modifies the simulation accordingly. For example,            if a user turns to look backwards over the left shoulder, a            sensor will detect the change in position and orientation of            the head, and adjust the visual display so that the display            corresponds to what the user would see from that pose if the            scene were real. If the user reaches out toward an object in            the virtual environment, sensors sensitive to movements of            the fingers and to the position of the hand enable the system            to detect when the user&Iacute;s hand intersects with the            virtual object, and adjust the display to mimic pushing,            lifting, or rotation of the object. The user may also be            stimulated by electromechanical pin-arrays that excite            cutaneous receptors and by inflatable air chambers that            excite deep pressure receptors of the fingertips and palm of            the hand.</p>                <p>Although prices are rapidly decreasing, immersive VR            systems still cost upwards of hundreds of thousands of            dollars (Rizzo et al., 1997). However, since not all            applications require immersion to the extent presented above,            more affordable, non-immersive VR systems provide practical            alternatives. These allow the user to navigate through and            interact with a 3-D computer-generated display, but do not            engender the same sense of actually being fully immersed and            enveloped within the simulated environment. The most popular            of these systems use conventional desktop computer systems.            Users view the simulated display much as they would an            ordinary computer monitor and interact through standard or            special-purpose input devices such as a keyboard, 3-D-mouse,            trackball, joystick, force ball or voice. Three dimensions            are represented through the use of simulation software            employing perspective, object rotation, object interposition,            relative size, shading, etc. Sound is presented via external            loudspeakers, and a sensor can also be added at minimal cost            to track head position.</p>                <p>The boundary between immersive and non-immersive systems            is not clear-cut, since the creative use of display and            auditory peripherals can promote the sense of presence even            in the absence of the ability to fully control the virtual            environment. In projected VR, for example, users see images            of themselves overlaid on the simulated environment, and a            movement tracking device captures the actions of the user and            superimposes them so that he or she can interact with the            virtual world. In CAVE (Johnson et al., 1998), the simulated            environment is projected onto the walls of a small room,            allowing different people to share the same VR experience            simultaneously. CUBBY (Djajadiningrat et al., 1997) uses            three orthogonal screens and a small infra-red tracker            attached to the user&Iacute;s head or eyeglasses. The system            utilizes the simple depth cue of movement parallax to create            the perception that objects are in front of the screen and            available for direct manipulation, providing a key benefit of            immersive VR without expensive equipment and intensive            computation. Other VR technologies merely supplement and            enhance the user&Iacute;s actual view of the world with            virtual objects or symbols. In an effort to steady the gait            of individuals with Parkinson&Iacute;s disease, for example,            users may sport eye-gear that overlays the visual scene (the            walkway) with virtual obstacles (a step), to train them in            lifting their legs at each step (Emmett, 1994; see also            Jaffe, 1998).</p>                <p>Although their fixed display position and limited display            area limit the user&#39;s range of interactions, these            non-immersive systems have an advantage in that the user is            not tethered by glove and helmet and is able to communicate            freely with non-VR participants. Desktop virtual reality            systems are now less than $10,000, and costs will continue to            decrease (Blackburn, 1996; Rizzo et al., 1997).</p>                <p>Non-immersive VR is often used to teach knowledge, and            immersive VR to teach knowledge, skills, and attitudes            (Davies and Helmreich, 1997). This distinction is highlighted            in two travel applications for home and professional use,            currently under development by the European Union&Iacute;s            Collaborative Virtual Environments project (COVEN) (Slater et            al., 1998). The Business Traveller uses a high-end immersive            VR system to enable a small group of individuals to prepare            for a coming event by rehearsing possible outcomes in            simulations of different situations and environments. For            such an application, timing may be vital and interaction with            colleagues frequent. Immersion is required so as to maximize            the chance of participants learning appropriate behavior that            can be transferred to the real-life situation. Still at an            experimental stage, the system presently allows travelers to            rehearse a simple journey from Heathrow airport to a local            institution, experimenting with different modes of            transportation.</p>                <p>The Citizen Traveller is a virtual marketing and browsing            facility which provides a large amount of information            (logistics, cultural events, history) on a travel destination            as a support to vacation planning. In contrast to the            capabilities of the Business Traveller, this application uses            a non-immersive, desktop approach. It consists of a number of            separate virtual environments (zones) displayed on a screen            or monitor. Each zone has its own purpose, and users can move            easily amongst them. The 3-D metaphors are used as a            &iuml;natural&Iacute; and enticing way to provide access to            data about a holiday destination, although the application            goes beyond just retrieval of information. Users can view the            site they wish to visit, seek advice from on-line travel            agents and local guides, and communicate with other users,            who can offer help, display locations, and accompany them on            the excursion. The interactivity and collaboration provided            by the Citizen Traveller heightens the sense of presence, but            does not convey a feeling of actually being at the travel            destination. The Business Traveller, on the other hand, is            intended to provide users with a feeling of being surrounded            by the environment, in order to enable rehearsal of and            training for real-life situations.</p>                <h2>Virtual Reality and Work</h2>               <br /> <br />                            <p>The unique features and flexibility of VR give it            extraordinary potential for use in work-related applications.            It permits users to experience and interact with life-like            models or environments, in safety and at convenient times,            while providing a degree of control over the simulation that            is usually not possible in real life. Workers can use virtual            reality to learn to perform routine tasks without pressure,            to learn simple components of more complex tasks and to react            to infrequently occurring situations such as the preferred            response to dangerous events. Exposure to innovations at            work, e.g., the retooling of an assembly line, via virtual            reality can alleviate worker apprehension by providing an            opportunity to practice new techniques prior to their            implementation. Workers in need of vocational retraining,            particularly those who have sustained major physical or            psychological impairment, can be evaluated while trying out            highly realistic simulated tasks. They, in turn, have an            opportunity to explore whether the new job meets their            abilities and interests.</p>                <p>By supplementing traditional training with VR simulation,            the cognitive and motor demands of a task can be gradually            increased and the trainee&Iacute;s interest and confidence            can be enhanced by means of competitive or entertainment            elements. VR can thus provide benefits that are not only            economic, such as savings in staffing, time, and equipment,            but also psychological, since a well-designed VR simulation            can be motivating and enjoyable to the trainee (Barfield and            Weghorst, 1993, cited in Barfield et al., 1995)</p>                <p>One of the most important applications of VR to the work            setting is the analysis of a job site and its component            tasks. The representation of a specific work site as a            virtual environment enables the ergonomist to view it from a            variety of angles and approaches, providing a greater            understanding of how the tasks are performed. Moreover, it is            easy to make changes in the location and orientation of            virtual support surfaces and the placement of virtual work            tools and manufactured goods. One can then test the effect            these changes will have on both worker performance and on the            quality of the finished product. Worker suitability for the            task can also be assessed during the initial screening of job            candidates. Already regarded by clinical neurologists and            psychometrists as the next step in cognitive-perceptual            assessment (Rose et al., 1996; Rizzo et al.,1998), VR can be            a valuable addition to the screening and interviewing            process, enabling the simultaneous, objective measurement of            characteristics as diverse as spatial memory, curiosity,            ability to stay focused on a goal, learning curves,            orientation to unfamiliar settings, reflexes, as well as            evaluating the worker performance in simulations of the            actual tasks.</p>                <p>The work-related applications that appear to be most            promising are those that employ virtual reality for (1)            visualization and representation, (2) distance communication            and education, (3) hands-on training, (4) orientation and            navigation, and (5) workers with disabilities. Examples of            each of these applications will be provided in the following            sections.</p>                <p>A Visualization and Representation Tool</p>                <p>The interactive nature of virtual environments make it a            natural extension to the 3-D graphics that enable engineers,            architects, and designers to visualize real life structures            before actually building them. For example, the computer            aided design of mechanical tools can be enhanced with a            virtual reality interface which allows the designer to            navigate within the tool to the part that needs modification,            and then use a spaceball (a 6 degree of freedom joystick-like            input device) to stretch, shrink, or change the color of the            part, or sketch in a new feature. The designer can then            &quot;switch on&quot; the virtual model and observe the operation of            the new feature from different vantage points (Cobb et al.,            1995; Trika et al., 1997). Another advantage of the virtual            environment over other design tools, including those that are            computer-based, is that it enables the user to interact with            the simulation to conceptualize relations that are not            apparent from a less dynamic representation, and to visualize            models that are difficult to understand in other ways. It can            therefore be a valuable tool for the radiologist trying to            visualize the topology of a tumor (Fenlon et al., 1997;            Hussain et al., 1997), the chemist exploring ways that            molecules can be combined (Cruz-Neira et al., 1996), or the            medical researcher trying to forecast the effects of complex            combinations of healing treatments. Furthermore, a virtual            environment can be made to respond to actual or hypothetical            physical laws. Gravity, for example, can be suspended.            Because of this flexibility, the application of VR to            industrial and scientific design is one of the fastest            growing markets for the new technology.</p>                <p>A significant savings in resources can be realized by            testing out virtual reality models prior to physical            construction. Wilson (1997) relates how prior simulation of a            planned building&#39;s layout revealed serious architectural            shortcomings such as inadequate access to delivery vehicles.            Similarly a, wheelchair VR system (Murphy, 1993) helps to            ensure that a proposed building is accessible to people with            disabilities. In this fully immersive system, testers wear a            dataglove and head-mounted device, sit in an actual            wheelchair on rollers, and explore a simulation of the            proposed structure to determine its suitability for people            with disabilities. The magnitude of door widths, turning            radii in small spaces, and even measurements that are not            typically listed in building specifications such as faucet            heights can all be verified before construction. Although one            may argue that such information could be obtained by simpler            means, the fact remains that the virtual environment            encourages designers and users to interact to construct a            truly accessible building (Delaney, 1998).</p>                <p>The use of such &quot;virtual prototypes&quot; to augment or replace            physical prototypes can significantly reduce product            development time and costs (Wilson, 1997). Where changes are            required, machine components can be readily modified and            layouts can be quickly rearranged. Moreover, by allowing            users to view the product design in ways that are less            ambiguous to non-experts, VR promotes direct collaboration            with other industry personnel or customers at an earlier            stage in the design or manufacturing process. In the fashion            industry, for example, a virtual environment has been            developed that allows clothes to be displayed to retailers at            their convenience (Stanger, 1997). In an effort to respond            more quickly and accurately to market demand, designers            create virtual fashion collections which are then modeled to            buyers by 3-D mannequins who, in response to verbal            instructions from the designer, parade the garments in a            variety of poses and settings. Although VR prototype garments            would not entirely replace the need for the creation of real            model collections, they introduce an element of            designer-retailer collaboration which, in theory, can enhance            the quality and suitability of clothes as well as the speed            with which they are available for sale.</p>                <p>Considering its tremendous potential, the commercial            application of VR to integrated manufacturing has been            proceeding slowly. This relatively slow pace does not appear            to be due to limitations in VR itself; rather, it is related            to finding efficient ways to merge VR technologies with            current manufacturing techniques (Cobb et al., 1995).</p>                <p>Distance Training and Communication</p>                <p>With the advances in electronic technology over the past            20 years, the standard training format of having an            individual lecture to an audience has been supplemented and,            in some cases, replaced by the rapid development and            implementation of new training methods. No longer are            individuals required to present material in person to            trainees since information can be delivered to groups of            trainees situated in different locations. Until recently, a            significant drawback to distance training was the lack of            direct interaction between the instructor and the students,            since the ease with which students could ask questions was            limited and the instructor was deprived of the opportunity to            gauge audience reactions and adjust the presentation            accordingly.</p>                <p>One attempted solution to this problem is interactive            video teleconferencing. To date, this application has been            severely limited by the need to use special transmission            lines and equipment capable of handling a large volume of            video images in real time. Furthermore, when more than a few            users participate simultaneously, the large array of separate            video images to which each user must attend can be            overwhelming. It is no small feat to try to monitor and teach            a group of twenty, separately televised, students, even            though monitoring and teaching a class of this size is a            common practice in real life. Furthermore, participants do            not feel that they have achieved a sense of being together in            a shared meeting space (Walker and Sheppard, 1997) With            virtual reality, however, the potential exists for all remote            participants to be together in a shared virtual space,            interacting as they would in a real classroom. This could            bring a new dimension to long-distance education.</p>                <p>The concept of sharing a virtual environment is fairly            straightforward. Separate computers are joined together            through the Internet or other computer network. The remote            participants share the representation of the same virtual            world and interact with one another. The crudest forms of            this &quot;networked virtual reality&quot; are text-based. Each user is            presented with a textual representation of a room in which            there are various objects and other people with whom he or            she may &quot;talk.&quot; Talking in this context means using the            keyboard to communicate with other people in the shared            imaginary space and reading their responses on a monitor.            Objects in the room, such as virtual blackboards and slide            projectors, are interactive and can respond to commands from            the users. These virtual environments are currently being            used as conferencing tools on the Internet and, despite the            crude textual representation, they do give users a sense of            &quot;being there&quot;. Of 53 participants who had attended one such            Internet-based conference, partaking in real-time, scheduled            scientific discussions over a four-week period, 74 % reported            feeling a sense of actually being in the same room with            others (Towell and Towell, 1995). Similar results were            obtained for two groups of university students who            participated in one-hour virtual sessions with their            classmates and instructor (Towell and Towell, 1997).</p>                <p>In a more advanced form of networked VR, each participant            is presented with an image of all of the other participants,            represented by an avatar (an animated graphical            representation) seated around a table, with each            participant&Iacute;s speech, body movements and gestures            tracked and relayed to the other participants (e.g., Pratt et            al., 1997). The presence of virtual people and the ability to            interact with them in this way promotes user immersion,            making the virtual experience more real. This technology            obviously holds great promise for collaborative work and            teleconferencing.</p>                <p>Sophisticated networked VR technology has been applied to            military applications for several years. The Naval            Postgraduate School Networked vehicle simulator has brought            together several hundred remote participants in an immersive            virtual environment consisting of a realistic rendition of a            very large area (Pratt et al., 1995). The major goal of this            application has been to lower training costs. Even though it            is a very costly endeavor to build such a network, it is much            cheaper to bring together personnel and blow up virtual            vehicles on a computer network than in real-life training            exercises.</p>                <p>Although networked VR is expected to become more            accessible and affordable, it is not yet available on a wide            scale due to the requirement for intensive computing and            sophisticated software. More significantly, insufficient            bandwidth is still a major limitation despite the major            savings in data transmission and speed made possible with the            use of avatars instead of actual video pictures. Existing            Internet services, characterized by a chronic shortage of            bandwidth and lack of quality-of-service, put severe            constraints on the complexity of virtual environments and on            interaction with other users (Parke, 1997; Schroeder, 1997).            More complex environments and forms of interaction require            more capacious telephone lines like ISDN (Integrated Services            Digital Network) which, until recently, were unavailable or            too expensive for most users. More sophisticated multi-user            systems have been created for corporate clients on private            intranets (Wilcox, 1998). These local networks typically rely            on ethernet links which are fast enough to allow multiple            participants to interact in the virtual worlds generated by            the most powerful VR systems commercially available.</p>                <p>The most advanced commercial systems currently are still            at an early stages of development and typically share the            resources and expertise of governments and universities.            Caterpillar, Inc., designed a system to enable engineers from            geographically remote locations to collaborate in designing            Caterpillar products. Although intended for use over a            trans-Atlantic link, so far the system has only been tested            between three VR systems using government supercomputers and            a local ethernet. Under those conditions, transmission            quality was excellent and participants felt their            communication to be quite natural. Even more impressive            results were reported in virtual meetings between BT            Laboratories and five British universities (Greenhalgh et            al., 1997).</p>                <p>The richness of virtual environments, networked or            otherwise, is continually being enhanced by complementary            technologies under development. Researchers have recently            developed a family of computer systems for recognizing faces,            expressions, gestures, and speech (Pentland, 1996; Pentland            and Bobick, 1998). These systems are attached to &quot;smart            rooms,&quot; areas furnished with cameras and microphones which            relay information to computers for analysis. This technique            allows people in the room to use their actions, voices, and            expressions to communicate with the computer, which in turn            controls a virtual reality display. A teaching program, for            example, could tell if its students are starting to look            bored, and modify its virtual reality presentation in            response. While such intuitive, multimodal interfaces will            probably not be available and affordable in the near future,            they will be necessary to take full advantage of the            potential of VR distance training and communication.</p>                <p>Hands-on Training</p>                <p>The most common work-related applications of virtual            reality are those that utilize its immersive and interactive            nature to approximate actual hands-on training. VR is            currently used to train operators of various kinds of            equipment, where initial training in a virtual environment            can avoid the expense, danger, and problems of monitoring and            control associated with training in the real life situation.            For example, VR can be used to train individuals to perform            tasks in dangerous situations and hostile environments, such            as in radioactive emergencies or icy road conditions. In            addition to the assurance of safety, the use of a virtual            training environment gives the trainer total control over            many aspects of the trainee&Iacute;s performance. The virtual            environment can be readily modified, either to provide new            challenges through adjusting levels of difficulty or to            provide training prompts to facilitate learning. It gives an            opportunity to pause training for discussion or other means            of instruction, and enables the recording of a full history            of the trainee&Iacute;s performance. The best-known example            of VR hands-on training is flight simulation, but VR training            is increasingly being used in the initial training of divers,            surgeons (Hoffman and Vu, 1997, Klaue et al.,1997, Railhac et            al., 1997), anaesthesiologists (Bostrom et al.1993 in Wickens            and Baker, 1995; Katz et al., 1997), and shipboard            fire-fighters (Tate et al., 1997).</p>                <p>A number of highly successful and rapidly developing            applications involve the use of VR to train medical            personnel. For example, VR provides medical and paramedical            students with a dynamic medium for the study of human anatomy            and physiology. In contrast to the use of cadavers which can            only be dissected once and which are becoming more difficult            to procure, VR allows students to access libraries of healthy            and pathologic body tissue 3-D images at their convenience,            and perform the same dissection repeatedly while viewing the            various body parts from a variety of angles and perspectives.            Particularly helpful in this endeavor are commercial versions            of the National Library of Medicine&Iacute;s &quot;Visible Human&quot;            data set (Fasel et al., 1997).</p>                <p>VR also holds great promise in the training of diagnostic            skills, particularly when used in conjunction with haptic            interfaces which provide force and touch feedback to the hand            and digits of the person manipulating the instrumented tool.            One application involves the training of young physicians to            palpate malignancies, for example, in the liver (Dinsmore,            Langrana, Budea and Ladeji,1997) and prostate (Burdea,            Patounakis and Popescu, 1998). Preliminary results indicate            that tumor detection rates using VR ranged from 50 to            90%.</p>                <p>Some routine medical procedures can be difficult for            novice practitioners to learn, causing discomfort and pain to            the patient until they are mastered. Hands-on instruction in            such procedures using VR has been encouraging. Anesthesiology            residents have been trained to inject analgesic drugs into            the epidural space by manipulating an instrumented needle on            a virtual patient. The trainee &quot;feels&quot; the different forces            associated with puncturing the skin, traversing the            intervertebral ligament, and entering the cerebral spinal            fluid. Even erroneous contact with bone is sensed as a            sudden, large increase in resistance. The haptic feedback is            supplemented, when desired, with visual tracking, enabling            the physician to observe the needle&Iacute;s exact anatomical            location, a feat obviously not possible in real life. In            another application, nursing students have been trained for            IV needle insertion on a VR system consisting of a haptic            interface combined with a graphic simulation of a            patient&Iacute;s arm. As in the previous example, trainees            feel differences in tissue resistance as the needle is            inserted toward the target blood vessel. Students know when            they have been successful since a virtual syringe fills with            blood upon the accurate insertion of the IV needle.</p>                <p>Finally, VR is now being used to train physicians to carry            out intricate surgical procedures such as laparoscopies,            arthroscopies, endoscopies and other minimally invasive            surgeries (e.g., Taffinder et al., 1998). VR provides a view            of the surgical field normally blocked during such procedures            and enables trainees to get much needed practice in the            left-right motion inversion obligatory for the operation of            instruments in minimally invasive surgery.</p>                <p>Virtual environments are being used not only to produce a            realistic simulation for training purposes, but also in the            actual operation of the equipment itself. Although robotic            arms have long been used in combination with remote cameras            and other instruments to allow users to operate from a            distant location (teleoperation), with recent advances in            position and force sensing gloves and other interface            technologies (e.g., Yun et al., 1997), VR is seen as offering            a more natural and intuitive form of interaction (Mine,            1997). For this reason, applications of VR include not only            manipulation of instruments in remote or dangerous            environments, but, as seen above, is also particularly suited            to the performance of delicate microsurgery.</p>                <p>VR has been suggested for training and education in            occupational health and safety. The technology is already            used in disaster response training, whether to train airport            crews in handling airline crashes using highly realistic            simulations (Lavitt 1996) or to simulate the decontamination            process of hazardous radioactive sites (Briggs, 1996).            However, the utility of VR extends beyond training            appropriate responses to disasters, to assisting in the            promotion of prevention efforts. Actual experience with a            hazard has been demonstrated as a powerful incentive to adopt            mitigation measures (Smith, 1992, cited in Mitchell, 1997).            For example, usually little is done about an earthquake            threat until the disaster has occurred at which time there is            a flurry of relief activity (Mitchell, 1998). Obviously, it            is not feasible to summon hazard events at will where            potential victims are exposed to peril, but virtual reality            enables a simulation of the hazard where, unlike video (where            the participant is a passive viewer), one can interact with            phenomena, change them, and then observe the consequences.            For example, researchers have developed a VE to train nuclear            power plant maintenance workers to disassemble a check valve,            which allows trainees to execute tasks even in the wrong            order, experience resultant consequence, and perform the            appropriate tasks to be done in response to the mistake            (Yoshikawa et al., 1997). Such active participation within            the hazardous situation can stimulate users to undertake            mitigation steps that might otherwise remain undone            (Mitchell, 1997).</p>                <p>Orientation and Navigation</p>                <p>Virtual reality is well suited to helping users learn to            navigate in unfamiliar or complex surroundings. A number of            studies have shown that navigation in virtual reality models            of complex buildings generalizes to actual buildings            (Goldberg, 1994; Regian et al., Unpublished). Other studies            have found that military personnel using self-guided virtual            terrain environments can learn successfully the actual            physical terrain that had been simulated (Johnson, 1994),            although the extent of transfer seems to depend on a number            of individual factors (Darken and Banker, 1998). Researchers            in Japan are developing a system to train guards for power            plants in navigating their rounds. In this application, the            VR training takes place before workers have been assigned to            the site, when the workers are as yet unfamiliar with the            look and layout of an actual plant (Umeki and Doi, 1997).</p>                <p>It should be borne in mind that learning to navigate in a            virtual environment is still far from equivalent to            experience in the actual environment. Therefore, VR            navigation is currently advocated only as a useful            preparation for eventual, real-life exploration within a            physical environment. In those instances where experience in            the real environment is not feasible, the VR experience will            only approximate the real-life experience, and may, in fact,            introduce undesirable and unpredictable elements into the            learning situation. Although virtual environments are often            built to provide exact representations of existing or            proposed physical spaces, studies of spatial learning have            shown that the user&Iacute;s mental representation of the            virtual world is often distorted relative to both the virtual            environment and the real environment it is supposed to            represent. For example, the user&Iacute;s perception of size            and distance based on viewing a virtual simulation is not as            accurate as for people who experience the actual environment            (Henry and Furness, 1993; Umeki and Doi, 1997). It is hoped            that such undesirable byproducts of VR will be reduced as the            technology advances and we gain a greater understanding of            how people relate to both real and virtual environments.</p>                <p>Learning to navigate and function in unfamiliar            environments is one of several applications that are emerging            for individuals with disabilities. Using computer            simulations, children with severe physical disabilities have            accurately learned the layout of buildings, including the            location of safety equipment and shortest routes to various            exits (Wilson, Foreman, and Tlauka, 1996). In the &quot;Train to            Travel&quot; project (Mowafty and Pollack, 1995), people with            cognitive impairments are trained in basic travel skills,            including the recognition of landmarks, and are then immersed            in a simulation of a bus route for as many rides as they            need. This training eliminates the need for a teacher to            accompany them on real trips, which can require up to 15            hours to reach the same degree of mastery/adeptness. VR has            also enabled children with severe learning disabilities to            develop everyday living skills, whether in virtual homes with            interactive kitchens, in virtual stores where they select and            pay for groceries, or in virtual city streets for learning            traffic safety (Brown and Wilson, 1995). These efforts, which            have used relatively inexpensive, non-immersive VR technology            with flat screen displays, demonstrated favorable transfer to            real life situations compared to control groups engaged in            similar, non-VR tasks (e.g., Cromby et al., 1996, but cf.            Hall et al., 1998) for more equivocal results).</p>                <p>VR may also be the ideal navigation tool for large or            complex databases. Navigating hypertext, for example, is            currently a cumbersome process. Web browsers constrain the            user to see only one page at a time instead of allowing users            to get a sense of where they are currently located within a            more general context. Searching is an intellectually            demanding task which may involve iteratively comparing the            results of many queries in order to home in on useful            information. These problems have motivated the development of            an interactive VR browser in which one can access specific            Web pages while still having a view of the surrounding            context (e.g., adjacent pages, the structure of the part of            the Web that the user has browsed in the current session, the            links the user has followed in the recent past) (Benford et            al., 1997). An accompanying search tool allows users to            dynamically compare the results of multiple search queries.            In a 3-D representation of the search space, each query is            assigned a position in 3-D space and an icon represents each            matched page. The spatial position of the icon shows which            queries the page matches, while the degree of significance or            relevance of each page is shown by the size and shade of its            icon. The resulting 3-D visualization gives the user a sense            of which pages are generally interesting (big and bright            ones) and also which pages are most relevant to which            specific keywords (spatial position). This search engine            allows for many innovative features, such as flying through            the 3-D scene in order to home in on specific areas.</p>                <p>VR and Workers with Disabilities</p>                <p>Individuals with disabilities comprise one of the most            under-employed groups of workers. Reasons for their            difficulty in obtaining jobs include their limited mobility,            reduced manual capabilities and limited access to educational            facilities and work settings. VR can help people with            disabilities overcome some of these difficulties by            facilitating their ability to carry out some of the tasks            required in the work setting. VR enhances the accessibility            to work by providing the opportunity for individuals to            manipulate and explore without requiring physical access,            dexterity, and strength (Nemire, Burke and Jacoby, 1994).            Similarly, those with physical limitations can benefit from            the flexibility afforded by an increasingly wide range of VR            interfaces, thereby minimizing the limitations of the            disability, which can be used as prosthetic mechanisms or as            alternative access devices. For example, the head-mounted            display can be used as a vision enhancement tool for people            with low vision.</p>                <p>Another interesting idea involves the use of 3-D            &quot;audicons&quot;, sounds that surround the participant that can be            moved around to control and navigate a computer system. Using            a glove interface, users with visual impairments can position            the sound in particular places, performing the same &quot;drag and            drop&quot; types of functions that are common with visual icons            (Lumbreras et al., 1996). In one of the most promising            developments, biological signals such as the            electroencephalogram and the electromyogram have been used to            allow persons with quadriplegia to manipulate objects in            virtual environments (Kuhlen and Dohle, 1995).</p>                <h2>A Realistic Appraisal</h2>                <p>There has been considerable speculation and enthusiasm            among would-be users regarding the potential of VR            technology, much of it more wishful thinking than actual            applications. The popular media typically make exaggerated            claims about the current state of the technology. A more            responsible view is that, whereas VR has considerable            potential for many applications in industry and commerce, it            is neither appropriate nor desirable in all cases (Wilson,            1997).</p>                <p>For training purposes, VR certainly offers a degree of            flexibility in presentation greatly exceeding that of that of            other forms of computer-assisted tools. A virtual training            environment allows for total control of the presentation by            the trainer. For the trainee, as well, the ability to            customize the virtual environment to the individual opens up            a range of new possibilities.</p>                <p>In addition to its versatility, VR offers a number of            other features that are thought to make it a particularly            effective teaching and training tool . Foremost is the active            involvement of the users. Indeed, particularly in immersive            VR, participation in the virtual environment is to some            extent inescapable (Rose et al., 1997). The            participant&Iacute;s movements are tracked by the computer,            and produce changes in the environment, to which he or she            must adapt. There is speculation that this aspect of VR            reduces passivity and learned helplessness, problems commonly            found amongst those with physical or cognitive disabilities            (Swinth et al., 1993).</p>                <p>The delivery of immediate feedback, in a variety of forms,            is also thought to enhance learning. This feedback can            include the provision of &quot;cueing&quot; stimuli or visualization            tactics (i.e., selective emphasis) designed to help guide            successful performance. Teaching strategies such as errorless            learning are easily implemented, and the ability to make            mistakes without negative consequences in the benign,            forgiving virtual environment, all can have positive            implications for learning (Rizzo et al.,1998).</p>                <p>Finally, entertaining, enjoyable, or competitive aspects            can be incorporated into the learning situation to increase            acceptance and enhance motivation. The most overt use of            these features have been in learning tools for children, who            have a readier acceptance of, and familiarity with, computers            than adults, particularly when the task is made to be like a            game (Rose et al., 1997). The sense of presence engendered by            VR is itself correlated with enjoyment, which in turn is            likely correlated with task performance. (Barfield and            Weghorst, 1993, cited in Barfield et al., 1995).            Additionally, for any trainee, motivation and attention can            be enhanced by adjustments to the speed and difficulty of the            task, and by incorporation of music and other features suited            to the individual&Iacute;s taste.</p>                <p>Transfer Of Skills To The Real World</p>                <p>Because of its many advantages, VR seems to be an ideal            training medium. However, inherent to VR training and            education is the assumption that the training that takes            place within a virtual environment transfers to the real            world. According to Rose et al. (Submitted), to date, most            reports regarding transfer are anecdotal and there has been            insufficient effort expended toward demonstrating under what            conditions transfer takes place, if at all.</p>                <p>Among the studies that have attempted to examine transfer            from computer-generated to real environments, many have            focused on flight simulation which, until recently, has been            the best known and most sophisticated commercial application            of computer-simulated training. In general, simulator            training leads to better flight performance, but this depends            on the type of task. In terms of spatial learning and            navigational rehearsal, for example, Williams and Wickens            (1993) concluded that greater realism in navigational            rehearsal flights did not lead to better performance in a            transfer environment. Thus, if a helicopter pilot rehearsing            a dangerous rescue mission wants to learn the specific            features of the approaching ground terrain and the rescue            site, simply studying a 2-D map can lead to retention and            performance that is as good or superior to training in a            virtual environment (Wickens and Baker, 1995). It may be that            the mental effort allocated towards other aspects of on-line            performance takes away from the mental effort that is            directed solely toward navigational learning (Wickens and            Baker, 1995).</p>                <p>The findings from flight simulation research have also            been demonstrated in more general studies of spatial            learning. Wickens et al. (1994, cited in Wickens and Baker,            1995) examined how well people understood the shape of a            complex 3-D surface. Previous experience with a highly            realistic presentation (3-D, stereo) of aspects of the            surface was better than a less realistic presentation (2-D,            mono) at helping subjects answer questions about it as they            were viewing it. However, it didn&Iacute;t help much for            later memory and understanding of the surface shape.            Furthermore, the addition of stereo to the 3-D perspective            view had no added benefit to later understanding. A more            recent study found that passive, monocular viewing of a            complex layout of objects from a single vantage point led to            greater ability to reproduce the array than active, binocular            exploration of a virtual replica Arthur et al., 1997. Again,            these studies demonstrate that VR visualization is not always            an advantage, and richer or more complex representations do            not necessarily provide any greater benefit for the long-term            transfer of learning.</p>                <p>This is not to say that significant transfer of spatial            knowledge from a virtual to the real world does not occur. As            described earlier, even children with learning disabilities,            using modest desktop systems, acquired useful knowledge about            the spatial layout of a real building. Rather, results are            mixed, appearing to depend on a number of factors, including            the veracity of the simulation. More research is needed to            determine when transfer to real life situation occurs, and to            what extent.</p>                <p>Wickens and Baker (1995) examined the cognitive factors            influencing VR learning in relation to the substantial body            of research on the psychology of learning ( p.530). They            argue that the most successful way to teach concepts is by            having VR exposure in conjunction with and related to,            alternative, more abstract representations of the same            material. Thus, teaching physics concepts by VR alone is            better than by lecture, but the best results occur when VR            training is complemented with presentations of the same            phenomenon in a variety of other forms, including verbal            descriptions, graphs, and symbols or equations. They also            discuss the detrimental effects of cognitive overload ( e.g.,            if the display is too sophisticated), and the importance of            interaction with the virtual environment rather than just            passive immersion.</p>                <p>Presence</p>                <p>The essence of the virtual environment is that            participants can interact with it in a way that allows them            to relate the experience to the real world. This is the            attribute of &quot;presence&quot;, a subjective impression of &quot;being            there&quot; that is presumed to enhance the transfer of knowledge            and skills (Stanney et al., 1998). The determinants of            presence include the extent of sensory information, the            quality of the display, the ease of navigation, the ability            to modify the environment, and the how comfortable the            user&Iacute;s feels using a computer (Barfield et al., 1995;            Lewis and Griffin, 1997). Given the importance ascribed to            achieving presence in virtual environments, it is noteworthy            that necessary detail concerning these determinants have yet            to be identified and quantified. Indeed, it is not at all            clear when presence is a help and when it is, in fact, a            distraction (Barfield et al., 1995).</p>                <p>Rehearsal versus Desensitization</p>               <br /> <br />                            <p>VR is considered a valuable tool for rehearsing critical            actions, in preparation for performance in a less forgiving            world. It is therefore advocated for training individuals to            perform tasks in dangerous situations and under hostile            environments, such as in radioactive emergencies. However,            rehearsal in a dangerous situation may have unwanted            consequences. The user who makes mistakes and only            experiences safe, simulated consequences, could become            desensitized to, and less fearful of dangerous scenarios.            This lessening of anxiety can be an important asset in            enabling workers to maintain their cool under duress, but it            may also lead to a loss of respect for a real-life danger,            particularly where the hazard is experienced in a game            format. Similarly, if occupational health and safety efforts            present a virtual representation as accurate when, in fact,            the simulation is not credible, the participant could leave            the experience with the impression that the hazard event is            really not of much concern (Mitchell, 1997).</p>                <p>Side Effects</p>                <p>Many users experience physical side effects during and            after exposure to virtual environments. Effects noted while            using VR include nausea, eyestrain and other ocular            disturbances, postural instability, headaches and drowsiness.            Effects noted up to 12 hours after using VR include            disorientation, flashbacks, and disturbances in hand-eye            coordination and balance (Wilson, 1996; Kennedy and Stanney,            1996; Kennedy et al., 1997; Lewis and Griffin, 1997). Many            effects appear to be caused by incongruity between            information received from different sensory modalities, and            to the lag time between the user&Iacute;s movement and the            resulting change in the virtual display (Kennedy and Stanney,            1996; So and Griffin, 1995). These problems are expected to            improve with the development of faster workstations and the            modification - or elimination- of headsets in immersive VR            systems.</p>                <p>In the meantime, side effects are a health and safety            concern (Kennedy et al., 1997; Kennedy and Stanney, 1996), as            in the case where an employee operates a vehicle soon after            using VR. The danger is magnified by the fact that            users&Iacute; impressions of having adapted to the virtual            environment (i.e., they no longer feel ill) may mask an            actual worsening of the effects (Kennedy et al., 1995;            Kennedy &amp; Stanney, 1996 Measures are currently being            developed to ensure that VR users have regained their pre-VR            capabilities before returning to the real world (Kennedy and            Stanney, 1996; Stanney and Kennedy, 1997). In an interesting            twist, VR has been used to reduce the motion sickness that            can occur in real life (e.g., in altered-gravity situations)            (Kreitenberg et al., 1997).</p>                <p>Is VR an Effective Tool?</p>                <p>Clearly, VR is neither for all users nor for all            situations. While VR appears to have significant potential in            some cases, it is clear that it must accomplish a particular            objective in a substantially better way than traditional            techniques. Given the cost of even a moderately complex VR            application, the technical support required to operate and            maintain it, and, in many cases, the lack of evidence            demonstrating its effectiveness, it is fair to ask whether            virtual reality should be used at all and, if so, under what            circumstances and for whom. These are not easy questions to            answer. On the one hand, VR may save staff time and money and            be a superior way to train staff as compared to accomplishing            a goal by more traditional approaches. On the other hand, if            the skills do not transfer to the real world and if users get            bogged down in technical difficulties or experience            detrimental side effects, then VR has failed to live up to            its promise.</p>                <p>Rizzo et al. (1998) have proposed using a criterion of            &quot;elegant simplicity&quot; to determine whether VR is warranted for            a particular application. That is, can the            application&Iacute;s objective be accomplished in an already            available, cheaper, and simpler way? If so, then VR is being            used, as the skeptics claim, as an elaborate and expensive            toy.</p>                <p>However, the evidence gathered thus far indicates that VR            is a useful and effective technique for a wide variety of            applications. Unfortunately, to date, more effort has been            expended on the development of new equipment and software            than on the evaluation of whether VR accomplishes its stated            goals. The urgency with which this imbalance must be            addressed has been identified as one of the most pressing            issues to be dealt with by the VR research community (Darken            et al., 1998). Standardized methods of evaluation need to be            developed and systematic data collection protocols need to be            implemented. Specific areas of importance include feasibility            in terms of quality and service, cost effectiveness, safety,            and the accuracy, speed, and ease of use of new VR            applications. It is also necessary to evaluate how the goals            could be achieved without VR technology.</p>                <p>The rapid proliferation of VR techniques has prompted the            need for considerable research. In particular, it is            necessary to characterize the attributes of the various            tracking and display devices and simulation software and to            determine how these attributes influence user performance and            overall effectiveness (Wilson, 1997). For example, how can            the design and fit of head mounted displays and other            tracking devices be improved in order to provide better            feedback and minimize user discomfort and irritation?            Cognitive factors, particularly those parameters affecting            the interaction between the person and the virtual            environment, need to be investigated, and the substantial            body of knowledge on human perception, cognition, and            performance needs to be incorporated into the design and use            of the system. Which sensory modalities (visual, auditory,            tactile, vibration, force, vestibular) are most useful to the            VR participant, and when is the provision of multiple            simultaneous sensory feedback more of a hindrance/nuisance            than a help/benefit? Given the wide variety of technologies            available with a considerable range in price/cost, we need to            know how realistic virtual environments have to be, and to            what degree a sense of presence is required, in order to            accomplish the objectives of the virtual experience?</p>                <h2>Conclusion</h2>                <p>Considerable hype has accompanied VR since its inception,            and in many instances VR is not yet sufficiently developed            for economical use in work settings. However, the technology            is developing rapidly, and shows considerable potential. The            ability of VR to provide realistic simulations of data,            objects and environments, with which users can interact and            manipulate in an intuitive and realistic manner, opens up a            vast wealth of possibilities for work-related applications.            Those responsible for work settings should begin thinking now            of ways in which VR might be useful.</p>                <h2>References</h2>                <p>Arthur EJ, Hancock PA, Chrysler ST.
