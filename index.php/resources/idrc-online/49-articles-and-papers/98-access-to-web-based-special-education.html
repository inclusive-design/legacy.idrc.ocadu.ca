		</script>                   </p>                              <br /><h2> Introduction                              </h2><p>Although, web-based distance education programs             address geographical and cost barriers, they usually ignore             access barriers to students with special needs (i.e. those             with sensory, motor or cognitive disabilities). Distance             education programs should ensure that conduits, and not             barriers, to information are created. When planning a             web-based special education program the following concerns             should be considered: how to increase Web access to persons             with disabilities by addressing access issues on both the             client and the service side; how to optimize the use of             innovative web technologies to transmit interesting yet             accessible learning materials; how to increase community             amongst special education students and teachers.</p><h2>              Web Access and Special Needs                 </h2><p>A web-based special education infrastructure             holds promise for opening up new windows of opportunity for             students with special needs. For example, because web page             content usually consists of electronic text, a blind student             can use a screen reader to audibly present and navigate the             information. The font of most web browsers can also be easily             increased for persons with low vision. However, aside from             some of the inherently accessible properties of the Web, many             barriers can be unnecessarily created on both the client and             the &#39;service&#39; side. The phrase client-service, instead             of client-server, is emphasized because providing             education is a service, and all services should accommodate             persons with disabilities.</p>                  <p>On the client side, many types of adaptive             technology exist, including alternative mouse systems,             alternative keyboards, voice recognition systems, refreshable             Braille displays, and screen readers. These systems make it             easier for persons with disabilities to access their computer             and the Internet [Nguyen and Petty 1997]. There are several             World Wide Web browsers available that vary in their             accessibility features. Browsers can have keyboard             equivalents for hypertext links, frame navigation and             built-in alternative display modes. When creating a distance             education infrastructure, it is best to create a site that is             browser-independent and to avoid the use of proprietary             browser features or custom HTML tags. Forcing everyone to             adhere to a single type of browser is not optimal for the             diversity within the special needs population.</p>                  <p>Just as wheelchairs can only function if a flat             surface is available, client-side access systems can only             work if small provisions on the service side are present and             barriers are not erected. Simple, transparent web access             provisions include alt-text, text equivalents to image-links,             and standardized navigation schemes [Letourneau 1996].             Inaccessible web design can block access to information for             someone using adaptive technology [Treviranus and Serflek             1996]. For example information embedded in bitmapped text or             images without appropriate alt-text will be missed by people             using Braille displays, screen readers and text browsers.             Hyperlinks embedded within the bullets of a list (instead of             in the list items) may be too small for someone using an             alternative pointing device to target, and too indescript for             a person using a screen reader to differentiate. Overuse of             frames and tables can unnecessarily increase the complexity             of the page for persons with and without learning             disabilities.</p><h2>              Enriching Access through Innovative Web Technology                 </h2><p>Innovative web technologies can now be used to             deliver inexpensive, on-demand and interactive teaching             materials. Streaming video and audio can be used to increase             the richness of information transferred over the Web.             Captioned video can be created for those who are deaf.             Descriptive audio can be used to provide an unobtrusive             narration of video for persons who are blind, and text             transcripts of video or audio clips can help anyone using a             Braille display. The multi-modal availability of resources             can supplant some students needs for adaptive technology. For             example, a blind student can simply listen to a live audio             stream of a news report instead of having a screen reader             speak a transcript of the broadcast.</p>                  <p>Real time web based videoconferencing, audio             conferencing, collaborative work areas, chat rooms or IRC,             messaging boards and email can all be used for creating             interactive learning environments. New web technologies are             constantly being introduced into the market. However, each             technology should be justified in terms of cost, target             audience and accessibility before implementing them within a             distance education program. Sometimes &quot;less is best&quot;. For             example, a teacher discussion forum about an article on ADHD             can occur either through web-based videoconferencing or             email. The former requires tight scheduling as well as a             video capture card, a camera, and adequate Internet bandwidth             for each participant. Issues involving moderation, time zone             discrepancies and access can arise with video conferencing.             E-mail discussions however have no special hardware             requirements, have few or no access problems and can occur             asynchronously. Participants can compose their thoughts and             replies with as much time as required. There is evidence that             email may even allow deeper and more open communication             because of a veil of anonymity [Gold 1997]. Each method has             its advantages and disadvantages, but both allow             interactivity among peers.</p>                  <p>Generally, there is a need for enticing,             current curriculum for special needs students and teachers.             It is essential that curriculum is motivational so that             student will want to learn. Proprietary conversions of             resources from education-related centres such as, zoos,             science centres, museums and art galleries, can be created             specifically for special needs students and placed online.             Small collaborative projects between such organizations,             teachers and distance education administrators can target             resources that are lacking in the field. Once a teaching             module is created in digital form, it can easily be updated,             modified, reused and distributed amongst the special             education community.</p><h2>              Community Building for Student and Teacher Support                 </h2><p>A successful technology infrastructure cannot             be implemented by simply installing computers, software and             network connections into the classroom. It is important that             teachers know the capacity and limit of the technology. But             do teachers have fears that students will know more about the             technology than they will? Some teachers may initially oppose             the change and feel that they must struggle to stay on top of             the technology in order to teach it to their students.             However this should not be the case. The technologies are             simply tools for augmenting information access and             communication. If a quadriplegic student uses a voice             recognition system in order to compose his or her writings,             the teacher should see the technology as being no more             intimidating than paper and pen. If a student is attending a             class via videoconferencing, the teacher should not see a             &quot;videoconferencing camera and computer system&quot;, but view it             as a student attending class. The technology should never             overshadow the individual, and should eventually become             transparent.</p>                  <p>Teachers, as well as students, require access             to special education resources [Baker and Danley 1996]. The             advantage of web-based special education is that the             mechanism which allows students to access curriculum also             allows teachers to access support resources and to             communicate with other colleagues. Providing classrooms with             a web-based program can broaden the type and scope of             information both special education students and teachers can             access. Global resources, expertise and examples of best             practices on special education can be easily shared [Paulet             1989].</p>                  <p>One of the goals of any web-based distance             education infrastructure is to increase learning communities             and to expand the regular confines of traditional classrooms.             By linking together several special education classrooms with             web-based telecommunications and multi-user environments,             students and teachers from different schools will be able to             share resources, collaborate towards goals and communicate             with others who share common interests and concerns [Gold             1996]. For example an autistic child in a rural community who             communicates through BLISS symbolics only with her parents             and teachers may now be able to reach out and &quot;talk&quot; to other             children using BLISS via a web medium.</p>                  <p>Personal tutors are sometimes used for children             who must stay at home due to medical reasons. One             disadvantage to this strategy is that the tutor cannot             provide group interaction between fellow peers, something             that is important in the social-educational development of a             child [Williams et al. 1995]. Interactive windows into the             classroom can be opened for isolated students through             web-based media and videoconferencing.</p><h2>              Special Needs Opportunity Window (SNOW)                  </h2><p>The SNOW Project is a one-year pilot project to             create a province-wide distance education web-infrastructure             for special education teachers and students aimed at             enhancing literacy and numeracy in the primary grades. This             work-in-progress hopes to provide an ideal model of web-based             distance education that meets the unique requirements of both             special education teachers and students. An information             resource, community network and videoconferencing system will             all be built upon a web infrastructure. Access technology             will be placed in several special education classrooms             throughout Ontario. Special education courses and workshops             for pre-service and in-service teachers will also be             available through SNOW. SNOW incorporates and addresses many             of the issues discussed in this paper. It is hoped that by             bringing these issues to the public, other web-based distance             education programs can make accommodations for those with             special needs and in doing so adhere to universal design             principles.
