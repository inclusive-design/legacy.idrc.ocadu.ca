		               <p>Dena            Shumila<br /> Jan            Richards</p>                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>             Before the invention of computers and computer adaptations,            the primary problem with blind access to information was that            manual means were required to translate large quantities of            printed material into braille or audio form. Screen readers            and brailledisplays were then esigned to interpret text files            which had been previously created with the average computer            user in mind. Optical Character Reocnition (OCR) software            then allowed blind computer users to scan printed information            into their computers. This data could then be read with a            braille display, a screen reader, or screen magnification            software. The World Wide Web (WWW), in conjunction with            adaptive technology has now offered blind and visually            impaired computer users the opportunity to access the            Internet: the largest repository of information the World has            ever seen. The recent popularization of the Internet has            spawned the growth of the World Wide Web: an easy-to-use,            point and click document retrival system. The fact that the            vast majority of the information on the Internet now occurs            in the form of primarily text-based Web documents makes it a            valuable resource for all users, particualrly those with            disabilities.               <p>Each World Wide Web document, refered to as a web page, is            scripted in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) code. Like pages            in a book, web pages can be complex combinations of printed            words and graphical representations. However, these pages,            unlike their paper counterparts, contain &quot;active&quot; HyperLinks            which, when selected,cause another pre-specified page to be            displayed. These hyperlinks can be either text, usually            displayed in a different colour and underlined or clickable            images. In addition to displaying other web pages, clicking            on these &quot;hotspots&quot; may display related graphic, audio, or            video information.</p>                <p>The HTML protocol provides a flexible, and relatively            easy-to-use technique for producing an array of document            styles. It is this freedom in the document creation process            that actually limits access to the World Wide Web, for            persons with visual disabilities. The following subsections            illustrate problems, and suggest possiblesolutions for            overcoming the limitations created by inaccessibility.</p>               <br /> <br />                            <h2>SOLUTIONS &amp; SUGGESTIONS</h2>             Writing HTML code for screen reader users is difficult at            first, because it often involves a complete change of            perspective on the part of the authors. Sighted people tend            to rely heavily on their ability to perceive the computer            screen as a whole, and depend primarily on visual feedback to            gather important information.            <br /> <br />                            <h3>1) OUTLINES:</h3>             Rather than assuming that users are capable of scanning the            Web document, and understanding its structure as a whole,            HTML writers should place a general outline at the point on            the page where a screen reader would begin to read. This need            not change the appearance of a web document since this            information can be displayed as Alternate (ALT) Text inside a            graphic page header. Similar explanations should be presented            at other points in the document, particularly if it is long            or divided into distinct subsections.               <p>These outlines are valuable to blind users because screen            readers only provide information about a document&#39;s format            one piece at a time. In addition, screen readers do not            normally alert blind users to the presence of paragraph            indentations, centred titles, bolded and underlined text,            columns... In fact, if the screen reader is instructed to            read the whole screen, the program will wrap around lines,            skip over blank spaces, and ignore text attributes like            highlighting and footnotes. It is then necessary to issue            specific &quot;find&quot; commands to obtain such information. Outlines            can identify relevant features of the document, such as its            length, the number of HyperLinks it contains, and a            description of its general content.</p>               <br /> <br />                            <h3>2) TAGS &amp; LISTS:</h3>             Tags can be used in conjunction with outlines to provide            information about page breaks and lists. For example: they            can appear as ALT Text within graphical page separators. The            Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC)&#39;s own home page            uses tags by placing a single dash on either side of the            tag&#39;s text. However, they can be implemented in various ways.               <p>Tags can also be used when labelling and constructing            lists. For example: &quot;- List with 7 choices -&quot;. Each of the 7            choices should then be numbered, so that readers can remember            the numbers of the choices that interest them. The numbers            also break up the text, providing a distinct separation            between each item. For the sake of contrast, sub-lists could            then be represented alphabetically. Avoid using the HTML list            elements, because screen readers may interpret these markers            as asterixes or ignore them altogether. Horizontal lines            should also be avoided, because a screen reader, working in            conjunction with certain browsers, could mistake them for            text entry lines in a form. Vertical lists may also be            misinterpreted by the screen reader. Although they are easy            for sighted users to identify, blind readers lack the            following vital information, when dealing with the typical            list format. When and where does the list start and finish?            When and where does each list item start and finish? Are            there sub-lists? How many list items are there? The need for            this kind of information further supports the value of            tagging and describing lists, as well as numbering their            items.</p>               <br /> <br />                            <h3>3) GRAPHICS:</h3>             Graphics present a serious accessibility problem, that has            little chance of being completely overcome. The old saying            that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;, sums up the            dilemma. Images and other inaccessible elements are commonly            used to deliver messages that would take several words to            convey. This means that information can be distorted, or even            completely absent from the perspective of people with visual            disabilities. Therefore, it is up to HTML programmers to            provide alternative access options for those elements which            can be misinterpreted by screen reader packages, or by the            browsers themselves.               <p>Text is obviously the most accessible medium, since it is            the only type of information that a screen reader will            readily interpret. However, many authors of Web sites fail to            make the distinction between actual text&copy;based pages,            and mere photographs of words. Alpha-numeric characters            contained within Bitmaps are not interpreted properly by            screen readers.</p>                <p>What is the proper balance between text and images? The            ATRC&#39;s Web site uses ALT Text for every image. However, this            ALT Text often conveys the message of an icon, but says            nothing about its design or its relation to the page. This            system, although functional, presents a problem for blind            readers who value information about visual appearance and            spacial position. For these people, a possible solution might            be to include a short description of these features in the            ALT Text of a page header. This method still falls far short            as a substitute for the aesthetic and explanatory role of            pictures. An area where ALT Text can prove somewhat            ineffective is Image&bull; Maps. Image Maps are pictures that            have been specially designed to be clickable. This means that            clicking in different areas of the image will take you to            different HyperText documents, or other related photographs.            The primary problem with image maps is that screen readers            cannot recognize them, or the words and/or graphical            instructions that they often contain. In addition, the            clickable surface must be navigated by a mouse, and            selections made on the basis of the image. Totally blind            individuals might have considerable difficulty navigating            with a mouse. For the present time, a text-only page must be            constructed as an alternative to the image intensive one.</p>               <br /> <br />                            <h3>4) LINKS:</h3>             Many sites, including the ATRC&#39;s, utilize clickable buttons            to provide the user with a better idea about their            destination and a larger target to click on. However, having            an active image serve as a button or link is a problem since            blind users will simply see the word &quot;IMAGE&quot; as a link to an            unknown location. This problem could be solved if images were            designed with ALT Text. However, because the ALT Text is            contained within the size defined for the image, small            buttons may not display their ALT Text properly. Therefore            the button should also have an external text label. The text            for this label should be contained within square brackets,            because many screen reader users have their software            configured to identify these words as HyperLinks.               <p>When constructing a link to another page, HTML authors            often use sentences like &quot;Click here to learn about the            moon.&quot; Unfortunately, they choose to make the words &quot;Click            here&quot; the link, and for people using voice output software            this can be extremely confusing and uninformative. This is            because screen readers are typically designed to move through            Web documents one link at a time. Writers are advised to            incorporate meaningful words into their links. In this way,            users who skip from link to link can get an idea of the            choices available without being confronted by a barrage of            meaningless commands.</p>               <br /> <br />                            <h3>5) FORMS:</h3>             HTML form elements, including input text areas, radio            buttons, check boxes, and pull down menus are intended to            facilitate interactive communication between clients and            servers. Forms allow for automated responses to large            quantities of feedback. The fastest elements for sighted            people to use are the pull down menus and checkboxes since            they can be activated completely with the mouse. However,            screen reader users rely much more heavily on text to            understand the page and enter their input. Text based            browsers make this a difficult job by badly distorting the            page to cope with things like pull down menus. A temporary            solution might be to use exclusively text-based input, even            though this increases the possibility of problems such as            spelling errors. The other elements must be redesigned with            access in mind. For example: avoid horizontal line breaks            because they are read the same way as text entry areas. Also            avoid default text entry which can be confused with the            preceding instructional information. When constructing forms,            it is important for writers to clarify where text entry            fields occur, and which information is being requested.            <br /> <br />                            <h3>6) ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:</h3>             In short, Web pages designed for screen reader users should            always be kept simple and concise. Uncommon typographical            characters or constructions should be omitted. Also, remember            that screen readers read every word, so make an effort to            keep things simple. Exclude irrelevant information, such as            descriptions of page borders and decorative graphics.            Simplicity will make it less time consuming for blind readers            to navigate a document. Efficiency is also increased if text            only alternatives to more image intensive pages are offered.            For blind users, loading images is simply a waste of time,            because they do not enhance their exploration of a site.               <p>Another important fact to consider, is that not all sight            impaired people suffer from a total loss of vision. There are            various eye disorders, such as colour blindness, tunnel            vision and, an inability to focus. Each of these conditions            impedes the processing of visual information in a different            way. Therefore, thought should be given to the size and            colour of text and images, the level of colour contrast, and            the design of the document&#39;s background.</p>               <br /> <br />                            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>             Increased access to the internet for persons with visual            disabilities relies on the willingness of screen reader            developers, Web browser manufacturers, and HTML writers to            cooperate with one another. Cooperation must also occur            within these three groups. Access standards must be developed            across screen reader programs, and Web Browsers must be            designed to accommodate these adaptations. However, these            efforts will prove fruitless if HTML designers continue to            fill their sites with unlabelled images, incomprehensible            HyperLinks, and confusing page layouts.	</div>
