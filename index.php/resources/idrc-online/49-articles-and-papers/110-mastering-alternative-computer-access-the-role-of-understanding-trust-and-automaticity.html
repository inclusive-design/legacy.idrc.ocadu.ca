This paper proposes that            controlling an alternative access technique should become as            automatic as touch-typing or speech. The process of acquiring            a cognitive-motor skill is discussed. Prerequisites to skill            acquisition and impediments to motor automaticity are            outlined. Factors which promote or impede skilled control of            alternative computer access systems at each stage of the            design, assessment, prescription, training and evaluation            process are reviewed. Several case examples are used to            illustrate relevant issues.</p>                <p>&quot;...we must make automatic and habitual, as            early as possible, as many useful actions as we can..The more            of the details we can hand over to the effortless custody of            automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set            free for their own proper work&quot; ...James, 1913(1)</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2><a name="intro" title="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>                <p>Controlling a computer through an alternative access            technique is usually a slow, physically and cognitively            demanding process. Many individuals who cannot control a            standard computer keyboard use computer systems to speak and            write (2). Alternative computer access techniques are            therefore used to replace the fluent, automatic skills of            speech, writing and touch typing. As controlling alternative            access systems is not the end goal, but merely a means to an            end, it is imperative that cognitive and perceptual energies            be preserved for the end goal of communicating. In speech,            writing and typing this is done by developing sufficient            skill in the motor tasks, which then become automatic,            leaving cognitive resources available for formulating and            communicating the message(3). Alternative access techniques            can also become largely automatic skills thereby making the            process of alternative and/or augmentative communication            (AAC) faster and less cognitively demanding.</p>                <p>Human factors researchers and cognitive scientists have            long been concerned with designing systems and training            strategies that produce skilled computer users (4-6). The            benefits of skilled use for even occasional users of specific            software programs are the focus of much discussion. For users            of computer based AAC systems the computer is not a tool they            occasionally use. It is a tool they depend on for important            if not vital human functions. For many users it becomes part            of their identity. As a result it plays a much more intimate            and personal role in the user&#39;s life than the average            computer. It is therefore of great importance that users of            computer based AAC systems be assisted in acquiring skill and            ultimately automaticity in controlling their alternative            access systems. To this end, insights and knowledge can be            borrowed from the vast body of literature on skill            acquisition in the fields of psychology, education, cognitive            science and human factors, and adapted to users of AAC            systems. Insights and guidelines specific to the field of            assistive technology are also required.</p>                <p>This paper will address skill acquisition as it applies to            control of an alternative access technique. Discussion has            been limited to this one aspect of a communication system            because alternative access techniques replace processes that            are usually skilled and automatic. This paper is not a            literature review on skill acquisition but an attempt to            glean general principles and practical implications from the            literature and apply them to the area of alternative computer            access. The recommendations made in this paper have not been            experimentally verified in the alternative computer access            field. It is hoped that this paper will assist in providing            the theoretical background for such investigation. The second            half of the paper will illustrate concepts discussed using an            example alternative access technique.</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2><a name="prereq" title="prereq"></a>Prerequisites to Skill Acquisition</h2>                <p>Two important prerequisites to skill acquisition are            understanding and trust of the tool, in this case the            alternative access system. Without an adequate            conceptualization of the system to be able to predict the            actions of the system and plan appropriate motor strategies            to achieve desired outcomes, the user cannot begin to gain            skill. Without the feeling that the system is dependable and            predictable the user is not free to master the use of the            system.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="understanding" title="understanding"></a>Understanding</h4>                <p>The mental processes whereby human beings understand or            conceptualize the world are the topic of much theoretical            debate (7). Although the terms and the specific processes            vary, the majority of theorists in cognitive science and            human factors agree that people gain an understanding of            their world and of phenomena in the world by actively            constructing mental models (also referred to as schema (8),            scripts (9), productions(10) or frames(29)). These models            allow us to make sense of the world, to predict what will            happen next, and to determine how to respond. Initially these            models may be very sketchy pictures of a phenomenon. We draw            upon previous experiences and existing mental models to            construct these new models. These constructs evolve, being            constantly revised and updated as new information is gained            about the phenomena or system being modeled. As experience            with the system accumulates the model is fleshed out and may            include &quot;motor programs&quot;, or the sequence of motor commands            required to achieve specific goals, and &quot;feedback templates&quot;            or familiarized patterns of how the feedback should appear if            motor actions are performed correctly(4).</p>                <p>How well we understand an access system can be seen as the            completeness and accuracy of our mental models of the system.            Misunderstanding, lack of understanding or confusion about            the system can also be seen as the presence of chaotic,            disorganized, incomplete, inconsistent or over-simplistic            models(7).</p>                <p>Human factors literature discusses both the mental models            formed by the learner and those prescribed by the            designer/developer or trainer. Because it appears easier to            reuse or recycle existing models than to construct a model            without reference to existing knowledge, some designers            prescribe metaphors they feel are familiar to prospective            users, in their interface design(7). One well-known example            of this is the desktop metaphor. A limitation of prescribed            metaphors is that they function best if the user is familiar            with the metaphor. Metaphors or models prescribed by the            trainer or system design should be relevant to the user&#39;s            world view. The desktop/filing metaphor is not optimal for            individuals who have never worked in an office or handled            files. In choosing metaphors the user&#39;s age and experiences            need to be considered. Another limitation is that the            metaphor should adequately explain the structure and behavior            of the device. It has been found that functions inconsistent            with the metaphor are learned more slowly than those            consistent with the metaphor. When the typewriter metaphor            was used to assist students in learning to use a word            processor, the delete and return functions were last to be            mastered (7).</p>                <p>Studies have shown that it is beneficial to suggest            metaphors or prescriptive models in system design and            training. Foss, Rosson and Smith found that users learn more            in less time when a metaphor has been suggested (11).            Researchers found that users perform better on novel tasks            (7, 30). There is also evidence to suggest that prescribing a            model benefits users even when the model does not hold. It is            postulated that the model although inaccurate provides a            referent for the exceptions(12). Thus, in introducing a            metaphor, similarities and dissimilarities to the task to be            learned should be pointed out to the learner.</p>                <p>Prior to introducing a new access method to the user it is            imperative that the practitioner have a complete and accurate            mental model of the system. In introducing the system the            practitioner should remain cognizant of the user&#39;s            conceptualization of the system and the task. It is not safe            to assume that the user has remembered everything that has            been said, and recognized the significance and function of            all that has been demonstrated. Accurate rote repetition of            the steps required to complete the task does not imply            understanding or retention. The practitioner should guide the            user in building a robust and sufficiently complete and            accurate model of the system and the task. (Light and Lindsay            (23) provide an instructive example; describing the            consequences of incomplete models and suggesting strategies            for facilitating the formulation of accurate models.) The            goal in introducing an access system should therefore be to            encourage the user to construct a mental model that is            appropriate to the task, helps the user deal with novel            situations, and allows the user to accurately predict the            actions of the system.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="trust" title="trust"></a>Trust</h4>                <p>Another prerequisite to skilled tool use is trust of the            tool or system (13). This is dependent to a large degree on            understanding of the system and on the trustworthiness of the            system. Trust depends on how well the system meets the            expectations the user has of it. If the understanding of the            device is incorrect or incomplete the device may be perceived            as unpredictable because the user is unable to predict the            devices&#39; actions or responses.</p>                <p>A trustworthy device is both dependable and predictable.            It is consistent in its performance. It lives up to its            expectations. Technical breakdown, or technical errors are            not conducive to trust, or new learning.</p>                <p>If trust is broken or mistakenly assigned the process of            regaining trust is slow and difficult, the whole learning            process may be jeopardized and the user may abandon the use            of the tool. It is important therefore not to instill            unrealistic expectations regarding the performance of the            access system. Another risk associated with unrealistic            expectations is that the user will blame his/her own            performance if the device does not meet these            expectations.</p>                <p>The more the system is trusted, the less it will be            monitored and observed, the less wary and vigilant the user            will be when using the system. When trust is established the            user will be more willing to experiment and take risks.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="superstition" title="superstition"></a>Superstitions, Bad Habits and Old Habits</h4>                <p>Conceptualizations of a system are not necessarily            accurate. Automatic behavior does not necessarily aid in            efficient completion of the task. Erroneous beliefs about a            system have occasionally been termed superstitions (7). This            analogy can be expanded to include maladaptive mental models,            motor programs and automatic behaviors.</p>                <p>Superstitions are usually seen as strategies for avoiding            bad luck or encouraging good luck. Bad luck in the case of an            access system is the malfunctioning of the device or the            entry of errors. Good luck is the successful completion of            the goal. Although superstitions are not based on completely            rational knowledge of the world, many superstitions are            gained through experiences of events whose occurrence is            incorrectly attributed. An example is a user who assumed that            globally changing the font of a text file before printing a            file caused the file to crash. This belief was based upon an            actual experience, but the blame was incorrectly attributed            to the act of globally changing the font, rather than a power            surge which happened simultaneously.</p>                <p>Human beings constantly seek meaning in their world. In            the absence of accurate information we construct models with            whatever information we have; however erroneous or poorly            founded this information may be (12). We attempt to            incorporate superstitions or erroneous beliefs into our            interpretation of the world by creating misleading mental            models. The motor programs or automatic behaviors arising            from these maladaptive models could be termed bad habits. A            user of a relative headpointer was seen to occasionally shake            his head rapidly from side to side. When asked why, he            responded that this brought the cursor back to the center of            the display. In fact simply turning his head to one side of            the screen until the cursor is appropriately positioned would            have been a more efficient and accurate method of reaching            his goal. His model of the pointing system described the            cursor as stuck to one side of the screen, shaking his head            would loosen it.</p>                <p>Superstitions when ingrained into the model of the system            are very difficult to eradicate and persist even after the            user has been given concrete evidence to disprove them. Once            these superstitions have led to bad habits, remediation            becomes even more difficult. A user of multiple head switches            persisted in hitting one switch much more gently and slowly            than the remaining switches. Following inquiry it was            discovered that the user had used a switch with a loose            connection for many months. Hitting the malfunctioning switch            with average speed and force resulted in double hits. The            habit, developed to cope with the malfunctioning switch,            persisted even after the switch was replaced.</p>                <p>Old habits, which were functional at one point, but do not            apply to the task to be learned, can interfere with task            mastery. The greater the similarity between the two tasks,            the greater the negative transfer is likely to be. A common            example is moving from operation of a car with a standard            transmission to one with an automatic transmission. The habit            of pressing the clutch, frequently interferes with            appropriate use of the brake and gas pedal.</p>                <p>Superstitions or erroneous beliefs about the system need            to be detected and eliminated early in the learning process            before they lead to bad habits. This can be done by watching            the user perform the target task and noting extra steps,            inefficient use, avoidance of certain steps, or errors. The            practitioner should assist the user in constructing mental            models of the access system that allow the user to correctly            diagnose errors and assign blame or responsibility            appropriately.</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2><a name="skilled behaviour" title="skilled behaviour"></a>Skilled Behavior</h2>                <p>Once the user has gained understanding and trust of the            access system s/he can begin to develop skill in controlling            the access system. As anyone who has achieved skill in            playing a musical instrument, touch-typing or playing a sport            can attest to, becoming a skilled user is a lengthy process.            Many hours of practice are required even after consistent,            error-free performance has been reached.</p>                <p>Descriptors used to characterize skilled use include (4,            14-16):</p>                <ol> <li>economy of effort (far less energy and attention is                 required largely due to the automaticity of skill                 components, this also implies that the mechanisms for                 performing the task tend not to be readily available to                 conscious awareness),</li><li>consistency of performance,</li><li>adaptability (performance mechanisms are                 automatically adjusted to compensate for a wide variety                 of task conditions),</li><li>speed,</li><li>dependence on internalized (or intrinsic) prompts                 and feedback rather than prompts and feedback from the                 environment or computer system (extrinsic prompts),</li><li>ability to anticipate the actions of the system;                 and</li><li>the ability to multitask, to carry on more than one                 activity at a time.</li> </ol>               <br /> <br />                            <p>Most authors see skilled behavior as multi-component,            including cognitive, motor and perceptual sub skills (3, 4,            5, 15). Automatic processing is felt to be an important            component of skilled behavior. As argued by Fisk,            automaticity, however, is necessary but not sufficient for            complex skilled behavior to occur (16).</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="stage" title="stage"></a>Stages of Skill Acquisition</h4>                <p>Most theorists agree that there are three distinct stages            in learning a skill. The specific labels for these stages            vary from author to author (4, 17, 18). In the first phase            (labeled as the cognitive phase by Fitts or the declarative            phase by Anderson) the learner collects facts, background            information, and general rules related to the skill. The            learner attempts to approximate the desired behavior            experimenting with and testing out various strategies. The            learner usually concentrates on superficial features of a            task, ignoring deeper structures or organizing principles            (19). Performance is slow and effortful, requiring the            learner&#39;s full attention. Outside sources of stress or            distraction significantly impair or disrupt the learner&#39;s            performance (20). In this stage learners who speak will            frequently verbally rehearse information needed to guide            their behavior. During this phase the learner is very            dependent on external cues, prompts, feedback and information            about the system (e.g., cue sheets). The learner leaves this            phase with a basic understanding of the task requirements and            a set of strategies. These are not yet fully elaborated or            integrated.</p>                <p>In the second stage (Fitts associative phase and            Anderson&#39;s knowledge compilation phase) the skill is refined            or smoothed out (4, 17, 18). Deficiencies in the            conceptualization of the task are systematically eliminated            and strategies are elaborated. Task components are integrated            and whole-task practice begins. Although frequently repeated            task components become automatic, task performance remains            largely under conscious control continuing to require the            user&#39;s full attention. The learner continues to require            detailed, accurate and immediate feedback regarding his/her            performance. It is during this stage that significant            improvements in performance are noted, not just in speed and            accuracy but also in the ability to anticipate system actions            and to generalize strategies used to other tasks. Toward the            end of this stage performance gains begin to plateau.</p>                <p>Only in the third stage does the learner achieve skilled            or automatic performance. This phase is characterized by            gradual improvements during many repetitions of the task. It            is the longest stage in achieving skilled behavior. At this            stage the conceptual model of the task has been integrated.            The user is able to concentrate on the higher level            principles of the task. Performance strategies are fine-tuned            for the most efficient execution. The learner is able to both            generalize the process to similar tasks and to specialize the            process for specific task situations. The skill is over            learned to the point of automaticity. The skill no longer            requires the user&#39;s full attention. The skilled learner            replaces or supplements external feedback with internalized            patterns of expected events which act as referents for            successful task completion.</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2><a name="consideration" title="consideration"></a>Considerations in Promoting Skilled Use</h2>                <p>All team members have a role to play in assisting users in            becoming skilled device users, those who:</p>                <ul> <li>design the system,</li><li>provide long term support of an access method,</li><li>assist the user in choosing the most appropriate                 access system,</li><li>train the user,</li><li>evaluate the user&#39;s performance, and</li><li>help the user in making decisions about updating the                 access system. Important research questions remain at                 each stage of this process. The role to be played by                 each of these team members will be discussed. Throughout                 the following sections it as assumed that the end user                 is an active team member and primary decision maker at                 each stage of the process.</li> </ul>               <br /> <br />                            <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="design" title="design"></a>Design</h4>                <p>The most important question for designers of access            systems is what properties of an access system make it most            conducive to skill acquisition. Human factors literature            contains abundant and frequently conflicting design            guidelines (6, 21, 22). However, it is clear in the            literature that a system that is optimally configured for the            novice user is usually not optimally configured for the            skilled user (4, 14). The access system therefore needs to be            sufficiently flexible to accommodate the learner at all            stages of skill acquisition.</p>                <p>Systems that make the required steps to task completion            self evident (or operationally obvious as termed by Light and            Lindsay, 23), lend themselves well to early acquisition. The            early learner requires much of the knowledge needed to            operate the system to be externally available (e.g., .            prompts or help files displayed in text, graphic or auditory            form). The novice requires easy access to help functions and            extensive support for error diagnosis and correction. The            novice user may need many of the advanced features of the            system to be turned off or hidden until the basic system has            been mastered. Learners at all stages of skill acquisition            benefit from a system that is consistent, predictable and            coherent (i.e., having a high degree of internal            organization) (24, 25).</p>                <p>Automatic performance is more easily achieved when a            system has the following properties:</p>                <ol> <li>the user can perform the task without reference to                 or dependence on external prompts, cues or timing                 (4)</li><li>the system is predictable and relatively stable</li><li>the system does not require visual or auditory                 vigilance (15)</li><li>the number and variety of steps required to complete                 the task are kept to a minimum, and</li><li>decisions to be made are kept to a minimum or the                 decisions to be made are routine, repeated                 decisions.</li> </ol>               <br /> <br />                            <p>Another design consideration which is critical at all            stages is error strategies. The possibility of making errors            should be minimized as much as possible. Error correction            should be simple and direct. There should be no opportunity            to make additional errors in the process of correcting an            error. It is estimated that even skilled users spend a            quarter of their time making and correcting errors. Errors            are &quot;disorienting,&quot; frequently disrupting automatic            performance and therefore requiring conscious intervention            before the &quot;rhythm&quot; of automatic operation can be            regained.</p>                <p>Unlike novice users, skilled users rely on internalized,            or memorized feedback, knowledge and cues (5, 14, 15).            Extraneous, external cues are distracting and cumbersome.            Help which is not needed is frequently seen as irritating or            even insulting to the user. The skilled user should have the            option to trim down the system for more efficient use.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="systems" title="systems"></a>System Upgrading or Updating</h4>                <p>Designers, developers, distributors and manufacturers have            one additional responsibility in developing systems that            promote skilled users. Once a user has developed skill in            using an access system, that skill is jeopardized if the            access method is not supported by the manufacturer, if            upgrades to the technology are not compatible with the access            system that has been learned, or if consistency from one            version of an interface to the next version is not            maintained. Mainstream computer manufacturers are well aware            of this responsibility. The QWERTY keyboard layout, despite            its inefficiencies and ergonomic flaws, has survived the            evolution of the typewriter and the computer simply because            of the large number of skilled users in the market.            Alternative access designers do not have the same market            forces to encourage them to support skilled use. Many skilled            users of directed scanning, quadrant scanning or reed switch            keyboards must abandon years of skill development and relearn            a new access technique because those techniques are no longer            supported by commercially available alternative access            systems.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="assessment" title="assessment"></a>Assessment</h4>                <p>The team that assists the user in making the best match            between his/her skills and an access system should seriously            consider all stages of skill acquisition. The process of            determining which access system best utilizes the user&#39;s            physical, cognitive and sensory abilities has been dealt with            extensively elsewhere and will not be discussed in this paper            (31). If the goal is skill acquisition and ultimate            automaticity in controlling the access technique the team            must choose an access technique which meets the needs of the            user for an extended period of time and not only for the            lifetime of the present device. A system that can grow and            evolve with the user without abandoning skills mastered in            earlier stages must be chosen. The team is frequently faced            with the dilemma of choosing an access technique that affords            the user immediate functional use without a large learning            load but also affords fast and efficient skilled performance.            These criteria are frequently in conflict.</p>                <p>It is commonly agreed by researchers that initial            performance on a task is not a predictor of skilled            performance (4). Thus to base a decision on whether a user            would ultimately perform better using Morse code or scanning            on initial performance would be greatly misleading. The            assessment team which advises the user, must look ahead,            considering what properties of an access system are conducive            to skilled use (as listed earlier in the design section of            this paper). As the time and energy investment of mastering            more than one access technique would be prohibitive, the            assessment team must extrapolate their knowledge of the            user&#39;s skills and needs to encompass likely changes which            would affect the choice of access systems. Prescription            guidelines and modeling techniques that help to predict            skilled performance can assist the team in making long term            recommendations (32,33). This field also needs to continue to            amass a body of data regarding access control at various            stages of the skill acquisition continuum. This data would            help clinicians predict potential for skill-based use and            provide general guidelines for facilitating skilled            alternative computer access.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="training" title="training"></a>Training</h4>                <p>If skill acquisition is the goal it becomes immediately            apparent that training must be much more systematic and long            term than is presently possible in most clinics or assessment            centers. The relevant question for the trainer and user is            what type of training is most conducive to skill acquisition.            There is considerable controversy in the literature on the            optimal training strategy (26, 15, 4). Researchers disagree            on whether it is better to train in isolation or in context,            whether to practice the whole task or its components, whether            uninterrupted consistent repetitions of the same task or            separated variations of a task are more beneficial, and            whether a more structured guidance approach to learning or an            unstructured discovery approach is better. Synthesis of the            data suggests that the optimal training strategy depends on            the user, the task. A mixture of training and practice            strategies and schedules is probably required. User            preference should play a large part in designing a training            paradigm.</p>                <p>Lane (4) lists three methods of decomposing a task for            training and practice, these are:</p>                <p>a) Task simplification - here the task is redesigned into            gradations of complexity. The user learns and practices a            functional but less complex whole task which incorporates all            or nearly all the component skills and informational concepts            of the complete task. Once the simpler version of the task is            learned the next level of complexity is introduced. This            approach is also called the training wheels approach, in that            the user immediately attains the goal of the task but through            a simpler method (27). This approach would likely be            beneficial for very young users who require the incentive of            acquiring the goal and for tasks where the relationship            between task components is an important skill component in            itself. In the field of alternative access, Koester and            Levine have found that task simplification can promote skill            acquisition (28). Two groups of users were introduced to a            scanning access technique with word completion prediction.            The first group initially used the scanning technique without            the word-completion-prediction feature. The word-prediction            feature was added after several training sessions had been            completed. The second group initially used the scanning            keyboard with the prediction feature active. The first group            performed better and improved their performance at a faster            rate.</p>                <p>b) Skill decomposition - in this method the task is broken            down into separate skills or concepts and these skills are            practiced one at a time (e.g., hitting a switch, visually            searching through a list of words), before being recombined            and practiced as a complete task. This approach allows the            trainer to determine which task components have been mastered            and which haven&#39;t. As stated by Lane this approach is also            well suited for tasks in which one skill is more critical or            problematic than others.</p>                <p>c) Segment decomposition- here an intact sequential            segment of the task is isolated and practiced separate from            the whole task. This method is well suited for tasks where            one segment of the task is more critical or problematic.</p>                <p>There is an increased body of evidence to support the            contention that training which promotes optimal initial            performance is not necessarily conducive to long term            retention and transfer of learning. Variations in the            training task, training within context, interference or            interruptions in the training schedule, and a larger emphasis            on discovery learning all result in poorer initial            performance, but lead to greater retention and transfer of            learning (15, 26,4).</p>                <p>Just as there are no formulas for an optimal training            paradigm, the time taken to become skilled is dependent on            the learner (e.g., the skills brought to the learning            situation) and the appropriateness of the training methods            (4). Most authors agree that the more opportunities the            learner has for successful repetitions of a task the greater            the confidence in the behavior, and the greater the            resistance to disruptions by changes in the task condition            (3,4, 14, 21). Automaticity is achieved long after most            existing training programs have been terminated.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="evaluation" title="evaluation"></a>Evaluation</h4>                <p>The evaluator should consider more than the objective            measurements of speed and accuracy when evaluating            performance with a device. Possible impediments to            automaticity should also be investigated. These could include            inconsistencies or inefficiencies in the functioning of the            device, incomplete understanding of the device, or            inefficient strategies for completing a task. Possible            superstitions and bad habits should also be identified. The            user may need assistance in dispelling superstitions and            replacing bad habits with more functional approaches.</p>                <p>Mental models should evolve with use. As well as            evaluating successful task completion, the development of the            user&#39;s conceptualization of the system and the task should            also be evaluated. Is the conceptualization adequate to            handle variations in the task? Can it accommodate new            knowledge? Does it enable the user to accurately diagnose            problems? Does it allow the user to feel secure about his/her            ability to perform the task?</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h2><a name="changes" title="changes"></a>Making Changes to the User&#39;s System</h2>                <p>If the goal is skilled, automatic computer access, the            decision to upgrade or change the system cannot be made            lightly. Questions the team must answer include: if the            system is to be changed, which skills developed in using the            old system can be transferred to the new system, how much            will the system changes disrupt the performance of the            skilled behavior, and, are the reasons for changing the            system adequate to justify the learning time wasted and the            learning time which must be invested.</p>                <p>It is surprising how minor changes to a tool disrupt            automatic task completion, forcing the user to resort to            conscious control. Many of us experience this phenomenon when            we drive a rented or borrowed car, attempt to speak when our            mouth is anaethesized following a dental appointment, or            switch from one word processor to another.</p>                <p>Not only the justification for changing the system and the            nature of the change need to be considered, but also the            timing of the change. For example, if it is recognized that            the access system will not meet the user&#39;s long term needs,            it may be better to change the system early on than to wait            until the user has become skilled in controlling the present            access system. The user must be given adequate time to master            the new system before s/he can be expected to perform at            his/her previous level. Also, the user should not be expected            to adequately perform secondary tasks with the system (e.g.,            writing essays in school) before achieving basic mastery.</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2><a name="case" title="case"></a>Case Example</h2>                <p>To illustrate the concepts discussed in the previous            section, the design, development and use of one access            technique will be discussed. The author has chosen to discuss            a particular access technique because the technique is            intended to meet the needs of a group of users for whom the            choice of access techniques is frequently unclear.            Commercially available access alternatives designed for this            user group have been very unstable in their design and            availability. As a result, these users have experienced many            changes to their access technique and have frequently            mastered a technique only to find it is no longer supported.            Case examples will be presented of three users, each in a            different stage of skill acquisition.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="background" title="background"></a>Background</h4>                <p>Presently, there are few commercially available computer            access systems that effectively exploit the abilities of            users who have limited pointing abilities or who are unable            to time their actions. These users must accept less than            optimal speed or accuracy due to present technical            limitations. Users must frequently choose between direct            selection or scanning. Many individuals who are presently            using direct selection techniques do so with great effort and            frequent errors. Accuracy can be improved at the cost of            increased physical effort and decreased speed by strategies            such as a key delay which forces the user to hold down the            desired key longer, key guards, or larger spacing between            keys. The most common alternative, scanning, is extremely            slow and indirect. Another limitation of scanning is that            young children frequently require an access technique before            they can conceptualize the operational demands of scanning            input (34).</p>                <p>Alternative access techniques that bridge the gap between            direct selection and scanning can be grouped into three            approaches. One approach is to combine direct selection and            scanning in one device. Thus, users would directly select to            the extent of their abilities, and then scan to choose items            which they are unable to select, or select from a larger            group and then scan items within that group (hybrid            selection)(35). This approach is not offered in any            commercially available device at present but is frequently            practiced by graphic communication display users and their            communication partners.</p>                <p>Another approach is to use a form of coding where            two or more direct selections are used to choose each item.            The sequence of actions required to choose an item could be            either cued or memorized. In the third approach, termed            disambiguation, the user chooses a group of items and            relies upon the computer to guess (or disambiguate) which            item within the group is intended. Thus the user makes only            one direct selection to choose each item, unless the computer            has &quot;guessed&quot; wrong. It was felt that the coding approach was            most conducive to motor habituation and automatic use.</p>                <p>From the perspective of developing automaticity the coding            approach seemed the most promising. An approach using hybrid            selection techniques could involve more than one set of            operational rules for controlling the access system. It may            be more difficult to combine the rules from different            selection techniques into a cohesive mental model. By            combining two access techniques additional error types could            also be introduced. Disambiguation approaches are less            predictable and require the user to maintain visual vigilance            to possible system errors or wrong guesses. The user is also            more dependent on external cues to plan the next action.            Disambiguation techniques also depend on linguistic            information to guess which targets are intended, ruling out            the use of icons or graphically represented objects. While            each of these techniques may be most appropriate for specific            clients, it was felt that a coding approach lent itself well            to motor habituation.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="present" title="present"></a>Present Applications of Coded Access</h4>                <p>The most common code is Morse code. Although Morse code is            a potentially fast and efficient means of computer input,            several factors restrict its use by children with congenital            neurological impairments. Some users have difficulty meeting            the motor demands of Morse code. Users must reliably control            the timing of one or two actions, to distinguish dits from            dahs and to enter all elements of the code within the            allotted time. The training requirements of Morse frequently            restrict its use because it depends on the user&permil;s            ability to memorize the code (2). Systems less dependent on            literacy are frequently chosen when users cannot read (31).            Even when the codes are reassigned to symbols, children            frequently have difficulty in understanding the operational            demands. Morse code in its traditional form is designed for            the skilled literate user. The initial learning load is very            high and must be mastered before the access technique can be            used functionally. Knowledge required to control the system,            cues and prompts are not represented externally but must be            internalized by the user.</p>                <p>Various modifications to traditional Morse code have been            suggested or developed to make it more suitable for AAC            users. Vanderheiden (36) proposed a selection technique that            uses three reliable actions without the timing requirements            usually associated with Morse code (three-switch Morse code).            This technique requires three reliable switch sites and does            not overcome the training demands of Morse code. The            Handicode&trade; software program uses this strategy.</p>                <p>Providing the Morse code user with a visual display as            implemented in the RealVoice&trade; reduces the need to            memorize the code. The choices are displayed in a binary tree            structure. The user guides the cursor to the selection by            activating the appropriate switch at each branching. Although            the necessary knowledge and prompts are externally presented,            the perceptual and visual-motor demands of this approach make            it difficult for many users to make use of this            information.</p>                <p>In another form of coding, users point with their eyes to            a group of items on an eye-gaze frame (Etran), subsequently            indicating which item is intended within the group by gazing            to another group which indicates the location, color or            number of the item (2). Clinicians report that this is an            efficient selection method whose primary limitation is the            listener. As listeners must decode the message, it is            reported that even trained listeners are unable to keep up            with skilled users. The Etran is infrequently used because            the augmentative communication user is dependent upon trained            listeners and because of the physical barrier an Etran frame            creates between the individual and the listener (37). An            electronic system modeled on the Etran is the EyeTyper Model            200.&trade; This unit displays eight groups of eight items.            The user must gaze at the appropriate group and then at the            group that corresponds to the position of the desired item.            The display remains static. The gaze is detected remotely by            a built-in camera system (38).</p>                <p>Several researchers have explored a coding system for            users who can accurately target to a telephone keypad. Three            letters of the alphabet are assigned to each of nine keys.            The simplest application of the keypad requires 2 keystrokes            to select each letter (39). The user selects the key to which            the desired letter is assigned and then one of the remaining            three keys to indicate which of the three letters is            intended.</p>                <p>Researchers have demonstrated that selection strategies            such as those used with Etran systems are potentially far            more efficient than scanning (40, 36). Use of present coding            systems is restricted due to one or more of the following            reasons:</p>                <ul> <li>the initial training demands are high because the                 user must memorize a code,</li><li>the system is based on traditional orthography and                 therefore requires literacy,</li><li>the user must be able to time his/her response,                 or</li><li>the possible controlling actions monitored by the                 device are limited (e.g., eyegaze or pressing keys on a                 telephone keypad).</li> </ul>               <br /> <br />                            <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="statement" title="statement"></a>Statement of the Problem and Design Criteria</h4>                <p>A selection technique which:</p>                <ul> <li>could be effectively controlled through inaccurate                 or imprecise pointing,</li><li>supported the learner in all three stages of skill                 acquisition,</li><li>could be used with any representational set (e.g.,                 traditional orthography, symbols or pictures),</li><li>did not require response timing, and</li><li>could be controlled through a variety of controlling                 actions,                 <br />                  was required.</li> </ul>               <br /> <br />                            <p>The designers wanted to approximate the conceptual            simplicity of pointing, where the user points directly to the            choice and not also to another target that forms a code for            the desired item. An additional criterion was that error            correction should be as simple as possible: there should be            no opportunity to make additional errors in the process of            correcting an error.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="design" title="design"></a>Design and Development</h4>                <p>An iterative design procedure was used with numerous            cycles of prototyping, user testing and design adjustments.            Several on-screen keyboards for imprecise pointing were            developed. These keyboards were modeled on the ETRAN but made            use of the dynamic nature of the computer screen. The            keyboards were implemented in an on-screen keyboard program            called WiViK. The program runs on any IBM or compatible            computer running Windows 3.0 or 3.1. The on screen keyboard            can be addressed with any mouse compatible pointing device            (including head pointers, touch screens, joysticks, and            trackballs) or switches (41).</p>                <p>The first keyboard developed was a straightforward            quartering keyboard. In this keyboard all the selectable            items are divided into four quarters. The user points to the            quarter containing the item they want. That quarter expands            to fill the whole keyboard and is again divided into four            quarters. The user then chooses the quarter containing the            desired item as before and that quarter expands to display            one item per quarter. The user then points directly to the            desired item. Thus a user who can only point to four targets            can accurately pick one of 64 items with three selections.            Each selection act involves locating the desired choice and            pointing to it. (See Figure 1). The user corrects errors or            backs up through the process by activating an external            switch. The item entered is echoed by a voice            synthesizer.</p>             <a name="fig1" title="fig1"></a>               <div class="c6">                 <table border="1" width="300">                      <tbody><tr>                           <td align="center"><img src="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/rd/library/papers/papergifs/master_fig1.gif" border="0" alt="Quartering keyboard" /></td>                      </tr>                        <tr>                           <td>FIG. 1.

It was found that vertical and            horizontal head movements were easier to control than            diagonal head movements. To allow control through vertical            and horizontal movements the keyboard was redesigned. The            keyboard was rotated to form a diamond, thereby maintaining            the effect of expanding quarters (See Figure 2).</p>             <a name="fig2" title="fig2"></a>               <div class="c6">                 <table border="1" width="450">                      <tbody><tr>                           <td align="center"><img src="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/rd/library/papers/papergifs/master_fig2.gif" border="0" alt="Diamond Quartering keyboard" /></td>                      </tr>                        <tr>                           <td>FIG. 2.

Switch activation frequently            caused the pointer to stray from the target. When using dwell            time, users were more prone to make unwanted selections            (often when the user was resting between selections). Some            users had difficulty in maintaining the cursor on the target.            To account for this an averaging feature was incorporated            into WiViK such that the dwell criterion could be met by            passing over the target several times.</p>                <p>Another solution exploited both the form and location of            head or hand gestures. In this keyboard named the Threshold            Keyboard each quarter of the diamond is bisected with a            vertical or horizontal line. To select the quarter the user            passes over the line and back into the center of the            keyboard. The desired item is therefore selected by a series            of three horizontal and/or vertical head movements. The size            of the movements required can be adjusted by moving the lines            further from the middle of the keyboard.</p>                <p>Some users found the lack of tactile feedback when using a            headpointer disconcerting. These users found it difficult to            maintain visual vigilance of the position of the cursor on            the screen. They preferred to use four mechanical switches to            select the quarters. Direct selection of each quarter using 4            mechanical switches was added as an option.</p>                <p>Throughout the iterative process keyboards evolved whose            selection technique became less and less dependent on visual            cues and visual feedback. The skilled user, selecting through            thresholds or mechanical switches, can access the keyboard            through fluid habitual gestures whose successful completion            is signaled by auditory and tactile feedback.</p>                <p>The experiences of three AAC users will be discussed. Each            client is at a different stage of skill acquisition and is            using a different permutation of a quartering keyboard. All            three clients have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy and do not            use speech as their primary mode of communication.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="example1" title="example1"></a>User Example 1</h4>                <p>The first user example illustrates the incorporation of a            familiar metaphor into the introduction of a new computer            access system. Benefits of drawing upon the child&#39;s world            knowledge to assist her in conceptualizing the task are            discussed.</p>                <p>The user was a 4 year old girl with no previous computer            experience. At the time of the assessment she was enrolled in            an integrated junior kindergarten program. Her modes of            communication included vocalizations, facial expression, and            a communication display that she accessed by pointing with a            head-mounted lightpointer and listener-assisted scanning. She            gained attention by pointing with the head-mounted            lightpointer and vocalizing. Appropriate use of the            lightpointer was one of the educational goals identified by            her teacher. Her favorite activity was playing with a            dollhouse. This dollhouse had a removable roof which gave her            an aerial view of the rooms. She enjoyed directing the            rearrangement of the dolls and furniture in the dollhouse            using her lightpointer.</p>                <p>She was introduced to the original (square) version of the            quartering keyboard and selection using a remote headpointer            and dwell time. Due to experiences with a lightpointer she            had overcome the first cognitive hurdle of using a            headpointer, namely associating movement of the cursor on the            screen with her head movement.</p>                <p>To link the task to her world view and maintain            motivation, the selectable objects on the keyboard were            presented as animate beings. The task goal was presented as            making the desired item aware that it was wanted or chosen            (gaining its attention). The client&#39;s experiences with the            dollhouse were used as a metaphor. The relatively abstract            concepts of groupings were presented as rooms. The effect of            expanding quarters was presented as the chosen items stepping            forward.</p>                <p>A sample dialogue between the practitioner and the client            would go as follows:            <br />             &quot;Can you find the one you want? (Client vocalizes yes) Which            room is he in? Can you point to his room? (client points to            appropriate quarter but not long enough to fulfill dwell            time) You know what, they&#39;re a little slow maybe you should            point a little longer. (Client points long enough to fulfill            the dwell time) Good, there, now they are stepping forward,            which room is he in now, can you point to that            room?.....&quot;</p>                <p>Once the basic operation was grasped, the task of            predicting which quarter the item would appear in, following            expansion, was turned into a guessing game. Thus, this            subgoal was separated from the complete task, giving the            client more immediate gratification (a successful guess). The            client was assisted in &quot;discovering&quot; the principle. &quot;There            seems to be a pattern, look, if she&#39;s in this corner of the            square where does she go?...&quot;</p>                <p>The client responded well to this approach. After eight            half hour sessions over a period of two weeks, she was able            to anticipate which quarter she would need to point to next,            occasionally positioning the cursor without waiting for the            screen to completely redraw. However, the activity continued            to require her full attention, disruptions made her lose her            place or forget which item she wished to select.</p>                <p>The task to be learned was made immediately more            accessible, by using a metaphor which: the client was            familiar with, had associated task mastery with, and found            motivating. The metaphor provided the trainer with a            vocabulary and task breakdown appropriate to the child&#39;s            cognitive level. The metaphor also assisted the trainer in            making abstract concepts concrete and within the realm of the            user&#39;s understanding. Introduction of the new skill was            simplified by drawing upon previously mastered subskills            (e.g., use of headpointer, gaining attention by pointing and            vocalizing).</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="example2" title="example2"></a>User Example 2</h4>                <p>The second example discusses a user who moved from mastery            of one system to skilled control of a new system. Changes            which disrupt automaticity, positive and negative transfer of            skills between tasks, and characteristics of the second stage            of skill acquisition, are touched upon.</p>                <p>The user was a 15 year old high school student who had            used a directed scanning technique for more than 7 years. The            access technique was used to control a word processor (for            schoolwork and personal writing), and computer games. He            controlled his directed scanning system using three head            switches. A switch behind his head toggled, with each            activation, between causing the cursor to move up or down. A            switch to the right of his head controlled left and right            cursor movement, also toggling with each activation. A switch            to the left of his head selected the item the cursor was            hi-liting. Following selection the cursor remained in the            same location. As a result, moving the cursor to any one            letter or item did not involve a consistent motor pattern but            depended on the location of the previous selection and the            state of the two toggle switches (e.g., for a keyboard with            100 items this could mean up to 99 x 2 x 2 different motor            paths for each item). The client also made use of diagonal            movements of the cursor by pressing the two switches, which            controlled movement, at the same time. He frequently chose to            wrap around the screen, rather than traversing over the            screen, if this was a more efficient path (e.g., taking the            cursor beyond the bottom of the screen to cause it to appear            at the top of the screen). Despite the complex operation of            this selection technique, and the obvious impediments to            automaticity, the client had developed considerable skill in            controlling the access system. Although there were up to 12            possible paths from one item to the next (when both diagonal            movement and wrap-around are factored in) he consistently            chose the most efficient path. The client appeared to have            internalized the layout of the keyboard. When the screen was            adjusted so that the keys could not be identified the client            was still able to select items without errors.</p>                <p>Unfortunately the client&#39;s access technique was no longer            commercially available and his alternative access device was            plagued with technical breakdown. Given his considerable            skill in controlling directed scanning and given his academic            demands the team was very reluctant to change his access            technique. The team questioned whether the access technique            made most efficient use of his motor and cognitive skills but            did not wish to abandon the many years of practice invested            in the technique. An alternative keyboard was setup using            WiVik which mimicked as accurately as possible the directed            scanning system. The client was also exposed to a quartering            keyboard that was controlled using 4 mechanical switches.</p>                <p>Once the client understood the operational demands of the            two systems, he was given an opportunity to practice using            each keyboard for one hour. Comparing his speed and accuracy,            when using a) his familiar directed scanning system, b) the            system which mimicked his familiar system, and c) the            quartering keyboard, revealed interesting and unexpected            results. Although he was twice as fast using his familiar            system than when using the quartering technique, copy typing            using the mimic of his familiar system was slower than the            other two systems (see Figure 3). The WiVik-based directed            scanning system had an identical key layout, supported            toggling of the two switches, and allowed the same diagonal            movement and wrap around as his original system. The only            differences noted between his familiar system and the WiVik            system were: the visual display features (e.g., higher            resolution, a larger color palette), the presentation of the            cursor movement (e.g., jumping from one item to the next            rather than moving smoothly between items), and the sound of            the auditory tone used to denote movement from one item to            the next. It appeared that these differences were sufficient            to prevent transfer of the automatic behavior.</p>                <div class="c6">                 <table border="1" width="350">                      <tbody><tr>                           <td align="center"><img src="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/rd/library/papers/papergifs/master_fig3.gif" border="0" alt="Client&#39;s input rate in correct selections per minute using a) his familiar access technique, b) a keyboard mimicking his familiar technique, and c) a quartering keyboard." />                           </td>                      </tr>                        <tr>                           <td align="center">Fig. 3.

During            this period the client made rapid gains in speed and            accuracy, surpassing performance using his familiar system by            the third week (See Figure 4). During the fourth week the            client began completing his homework using the quartering            keyboard. The task of operating the new access technique was            not yet automatic. The client was still heavily reliant on            visual prompts to guide his movements, but could use the            position of the desired item on the first keyboard display to            anticipate which movements were needed next. The client could            enter several commonly used functions and letters without            visually referencing the keyboard layout. Negative transfer            of the habituated motor acts from his original access system            did not appear to interfere with mastering the new system.            This may be because the system was sufficiently different to            prevent interference.</p>                <div class="c6">                 <table border="1" width="350">                      <tbody><tr>                           <td align="center"><img src="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/rd/library/papers/papergifs/master_fig4.gif" border="0" alt="Changes in the client&#39;s input rate in correct selections per minute using the quartering keyboard over a three week period of use." />                           </td>                      </tr>                        <tr>                           <td align="center">Fig. 4.

Three types of problems occurred with            the switches: one switch did not reliably close on            activation; another switch required greater travel than the            rest; and the switch signal from two of the switches was            noticeably delayed. Unfortunately, the client adapted to            consistent or predictable switch problems (greater travel or            delay). When the problem was inconsistent or unpredictable            (i.e., unreliable closure) learning was disrupted until the            switch was replaced.</p>                <p>In this example abandoning a mastered access system was            unavoidable. Characteristics of the old access system (the            large number of possible steps to complete the task, and the            dependence on visual tracking) made it difficult to develop            automaticity. Contrary to expectations, the skills did not            appear to be transferred to a nearly identical simulation of            the mastered access system. This may imply that the skill was            not very stable or well integrated. Developing skill in the            new access system was aided by the relative simplicity and            predictability of the new technique. Required motor acts            (holding a switch to move a cursor and accurately timing the            release of the switch vs. hitting the appropriate switch in            sequence), were sufficiently different to prevent negative            transfer. The client&#39;s tendency to accomodate consistant            problems with the access system hi-lites the importance of            diagnosing and eliminating problems or inefficiencies in the            technology before they are integrated into the skilled            behavior of the user.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="example3" title="example3"></a>User Example 3</h4>                <p>The third example describes a user who has reached the            third stage of skill development. Design changes required to            accomodate his skill level are hi-lited. Factors which            supported or disrupted his automatic performance of the task            are discussed.</p>                <p>The third client was a 36 year old man employed in a            supported work environment. He used a diamond quartering            keyboard for six months. He controlled the keyboard using a            headpointer which detected relative headmotion. He indicated            selection using the threshold technique. The main page of his            keyboard contained the alphabet, numbers, punctuation and            necessary commands, with frequently used words, phrases and            system macros on subsequent pages. Subsequent pages were            accessed by selecting a menu key which displayed available            page keys. The vocabulary and keyboard layout of his main            page did not change over the six month period.</p>                <p>Prior to using the quartering keyboard he had used four            different access techniques over a ten year period. The            client reported that his most successful access means was a            reed switch keyboard (the Autocom) which was discontinued by            the manufacturer. Arthritis in his thoracic spine prevented            him from continuing to use arm movement to access a            computer.</p>                <p>The client made rapid gains in his performance with the            quartering keyboard during the first three months. During the            third month his speed and accuracy plateaued (see figure 5).            By the fourth month the user could enter items from the main            keyboard page without looking at the display. Frequently the            user allowed his application window to occlude the on-screen            keyboard and continued working. The client had no difficulty            in learning a complex application program while using the            quartering keyboard.</p>                <div class="c6">                 <table border="1" width="350">                      <tbody><tr>                           <td align="center"><img src="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/rd/library/papers/papergifs/master_fig5.gif" border="0" alt="Changes in client&#39;s input rate in correct selections per minute using a diamond quartering keyboard over a six month period." />                           </td>                      </tr>                        <tr>                           <td align="center">Fig. 5.

He was using a computer            with a relatively slow processor. Redrawing of the screen            following each selection of a quarter was not instantaneous.            As a result he had to wait for the computer before he could            make his next move. The client had learned to pace his            actions to the speed of the computer.</p>                <p>The keyboard must be redesigned to better accommodate the            skilled user who no longer needs the visual cues of expanding            quarters. This keyboard could remain static, hi-liting the            quarters chosen. If the user has completely internalized the            code, only the threshold boundaries, the section hi-lighting            and the auditory feedback could be maintained (with an option            to display the visual cues when necessary or when accessing            additional keyboard pages).</p>                <p>After the sixth month he felt that he no longer required            the key labels or visual cues of expanding quarters. The            client&#39;s performance was measured with several changes to the            system. In completing a copy-type task with the key labels            removed the client&#39;s input rate was 24.3 net selections per            minute (the client was asked to correct all errors during the            task). This was very close to his performance with key labels            (26.2 selections per minute). Interestingly, the client had            difficulty choosing the actions required to select a            particular letter from a list of possible movements. The            client was presented with three choices, in text form and            read aloud by the author (e.g. &quot;how do you enter the letter            &#39;a&#39;: 1) up, down, up 2) down, down, down or, 3) down, up,            up). When the client was asked to make the            movements required to retrieve the letter, he had no            difficulty. It appears that the sequence was learned and            habituated as a motor pattern but not as a verbal            pattern.</p>                <p>The client agreed to experiment with other changes to his            system to discover what changes would affect his skilled            performance. Several changes caused marked degradation in his            input rate. Turning off the auditory cues, which signaled            successful completion of required movements (with key labels            on), lowered the client&#39;s input rate to 18.2 net selections            per minute. The client appeared to depend on the auditory            cues to signal successful completion of each component task.            Without the auditory cues the client was forced to reorient            his attention to the visual cues. Changing the keyboard            layout lowered his input rate to 13.5 net selections per            minute. After one hour of practice with the new layout the            client&#39;s rate went up to 15.8 selections per minute.</p>                <p>The vocabulary, or keyboard layout is frequently the least            stable component of a client&#39;s system, however, this client&#39;s            skilled behavior was dependent on a consistent layout.</p>                <p>prompts and cues which make it easier for novice user can            slow down and impede skilled performance systems should            provide these as options which can be turned off when they            are no longer needed</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h4><a name="conclusion" title="conclusion"></a>User Example Conclusions</h4>                <p>Thus each client at each stage of skill acquisition            required a different configuration of the quartering            keyboard. While the effect of expanding quarters initially            made the task more operationally obvious and reduced the            number of keys to be visually scanned, this effect became            cumbersome in the later stages of mastering the system. The            clients moved from reliance on visual cues to reliance on            auditory and internalized motor cues. Careful attention to            the client&#39;s conceptualization of the system appeared to            promote skill learning. Consistent system weaknesses were            accommodated in the user&#39;s behavior leading to inefficient            habits, and reducing the impetus to fix the system. Certain            kinds of &quot;minor&quot; changes in the access tool caused disruption            of skilled behavior.</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2><a name="conc n future" title="conc n future"></a>Conclusions and Future Directions</h2>                <p>Although much can be borrowed from skill acquisition            theory and research in other fields, we need to build up a            body of knowledge regarding skilled behavior in the field of            alternative computer access and augmentative communication.            The common sense dicta, presented in this paper and by other            authors, need to be experimentally verified. Pertinent            questions include:</p>                <ul> <li>How much difference in skill acquisition time and                 difficulty do the practices recommended her actually                 make?</li><li>Which alternative access systems are most conducive                 to skill achievement?</li><li>What are optimal times to make changes to the access                 system?</li><li>What changes to the access system cause degradation                 of skilled performance?</li><li>How can changes in the client&#39;s system requirements                 (caused by maturation or changes in life situation) be                 accommodated without disrupting the client&#39;s transition                 to skilled alternative access?</li><li>What skills transfer from one task to the next, and                 how can this transfer be facilitated?</li><li>How do predictive systems and disambiguation systems                 affect the achievement of automaticity?</li> </ul>             As well as empirical research specific to this field,            practitioners need to share case studies and strategies for            promoting skilled users.            <br /> <br />                            <p>Choosing the right access system for a client is only the            first step in providing a client with assistive device            control. We must insure that the user understands, places            appropriate trust and develops skill in its use. Access            systems must be designed to meet the needs of the user            through all stages of skill acquisition. To maintain skilled            use the access system must remain relatively stable. As a            result the access system prescribed must meet the client&#39;s            long term needs. If we expect users to be able to participate            fully in social relationships, integrated classrooms and            employment, they cannot devote large amounts of cognitive            energy to controlling their assistive devices.</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2><a name="ack" title="ack"></a>Acknowledgments</h2>                <p>The author wishes to acknowledge: Fraser Shein, Gil Hamann            and Russell Galvin for their technical innovations in            programming WiViK; Debra Fels for her assistance in            organizing this paper; and Morris Milner and Penny Parnes for            their leadership.            <br />             The Ontario Ministry of Colleges and Universities University            Research Incentive Fund, IBM Canada Ltd., and IBM Corporation            are thanked for their generous support of this work.</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2><a name="ref" title="ref"></a>References</h2>                <ol> <li>James, W.
