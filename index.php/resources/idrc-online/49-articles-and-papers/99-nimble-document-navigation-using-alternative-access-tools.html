Formatting and layout            allow the reader to quickly find a specific part of a            document. When using screen readers and screen magnifiers            only a very small piece of information can be viewed at one            time. Visual communication of information regarding the            structure or content of a document cannot be used. This paper            will discuss developments on various fronts which make it            easier to retrieve information and manipulate documents when            using screen readers and screen magnifiers. Web publishing            tools, browser enhancements and document creation supports            within authoring tools will be hi-lited.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h2>Introduction</h2>                <p>When reading a hyperlinked multimedia document we do much            more than simply read the document word by word from left to            right and top to bottom. We approach a new document with a            series of questions. These questions are answered using a            number of conventions or strategies, many of which are            visually based. The first question is: what is this document?            We get an overall sense of the document: the topic, the            scope, the format, the author&rsquo;s approach, possibly the            level, by quickly glancing at the document. We also take a            quick inventory of what it contains (e.g., images, image            maps, forms, etc.). We get a sense of what the author feels            is important by looking at the formatting or other graphical            conventions. Concepts or points are communicated or            illustrated through pictures, videos, or graphs. We determine            what we can do with the document by noting items like forms            or links. We assess whether the document contains anything            that interests us by scanning the document for key words or            graphics. We answer the question &quot;where can we go from here&quot;            by noting links. While reading the document, we get a sense            of the organization or structure of the document, and the            emphasis intended by the author, by noting the format and            layout. At a glance we can determine where we are in the            document. The visually communicated structure also lets us            quickly locate specific sections of the document.</p>                <p>For many computer users this same information must be            gleaned by listening to a flat synthesized voice which reads            only text. In North America, screen readers are the most            popular computer access systems for people who are blind.            Screen readers present aurally, information which is visually            presented on the computer screen. Translating a rich visual            environment or document into the aural channel is very            difficult. The primary constraint is that, while we can            process many pieces of visual information virtually            simultaneously, the aural channel is largely serial. When            information is spoken using a monotone voice synthesizer,            information can only be presented one piece at a time in a            linear or serial fashion.</p>                <p>Screen readers were originally developed when computers            displayed only text. They were adequate and well suited to            the DOS interface which also presented information in a            linear fashion. However, today&rsquo;s interfaces rely heavily            on graphic devices or conventions, spatial layout, icons,            pictures, video and animation to communicate information.            Multiple pieces of information are presented simultaneously.            There is frequently no logical serial order to the            information on the screen. Associations between objects are            expressed through visual means (e.g. proximity, color coding            etc.). Interface consistency or predictability are not            prevalent (e.g., labels for text input fields could be            located above, below or to side of the input field within a            single dialogue box or form). Mouse pointer actions have            largely replaced keyboard commands.</p>                <p>Due to the evolution of the computer user interface and            the digital document, users of screen readers face three            major unmet challenges:</p>                <ol> <li>obtaining an overview and determining the more                 specific structure of the document,</li><li>orienting and moving to desired sections of the                 document or interface, and</li><li>obtaining translations of graphically presented                 information (i.e., animation, video, graphics).</li> </ol>                <p>People who use screen magnifiers or Braille displays            encounter similar constraints. The amount of information that            can be reviewed at one time is very restricted. When only a            small section of the screen can be seen at once, it is easy            to miss dialog boxes that pop up elsewhere, it may be hard to            determine the relationship between objects, it becomes very            difficult to locate specific objects on the screen.</p>                <p>These challenges can be addressed by modifying the            following:</p>                <ul> <li>the access tool (i.e., screen reader, screen                 magnifier, Braille display),</li><li>the browser,</li><li>the authoring tools, (e.g., HTML, SGML, plug-in,                 Java, VRML authoring tools),</li><li>the HTML specifications, HTML extensions, Style                 Sheets,</li><li>the individual documents, and</li><li>the operating system.</li> </ul>                <p>This paper will briefly review accommodations made in all            of these areas but will hi-lite accommodations in authoring            tools and browser utilities or extensions.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h2>Overview</h2>                <h3>Access Tool Developments</h3>                <p>Screen readers are slowly emerging which translate visual            properties into aural properties other than spoken text.            Screen readers are being developed which begin to communicate            visual conventions such as hi-liting, layout, color coding,            or visual grouping using aural properties. (<a href="http://www.prodworks.com/">www.prodworks.com</a>, <a href="http://www.citi.doc.ca/Citi-Mosaic/Citihome/Programs/TECSOE/Projects/ProjectsTECSO.html">            www.citi.doc.ca/Citi-Mosaic/Citihome/Programs/TECSOE/Projects/ProjectsTECSO.html#pc</a>,            <a href="http://homer.isye.gatech.edu/chmsr/Mike_Albers/projects/AW/AudibleWeb.html">            multimedia.pnl.gov:2080/staff/elopresti/ad/</a>)            These aural properties include pitch, voice, rate,            inflection, and various audio tones. For example, links may            be spoken in a male voice while other text is spoken in a            female voice, underlined text may be spoken with a higher            pitch, headers may be preceded by a number of ascending            tones. (Aural properties which have not been exploited            include background music and 3 dimensional sound.)</p>                <h3>Aural Style Sheets</h3>                <p>Proposed aural Cascading Style Sheets would allow authors            (or users) to specify the aural presentation of document            elements by specifying properties such as speed, voice,            pitch, stress, richness, as well as background audio and            spatial properties. These proposed style sheets must be            adopted by authors, screen reader developers and hardware            developers in order to be fully implemented. (<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Style/">www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Style/</a>)</p>                <h3>Active Accessibility</h3>                <p>Screen readers can only communicate what is revealed by            the browser, or operating system. Tools are under development            which would allow application developers to reveal necessary            information to screen readers in a consistent fashion. </p>                <h3>Document Navigation</h3>                <p>When using vision, overt controls are required to move to            and interact with: the menu, the toolbar, the scroll bars,            dialog box controls, links and input fields. In present            browsers this is frequently done using the mouse pointer. For            obvious reasons, people who are blind require keyboard            equivalents for these mouse actions. Browsers are slowly            adding these keyboard equivalents. When using a screen            reader, overt controls are also needed to shift focus between            various segments of the document, between frames, or between            different cells of a table. Unlike visual focus, the screen            reader must be manually directed to read the desired segment.            The need for keyboard equivalents to move between desired            document elements is being addressed by some browsers and            screen readers. (<a href="http://www.prodworks.com/">www.prodworks.com</a>, <a href="http://www.hj.com/">www.hj.com</a>).</p>                <h3>Text Descriptions</h3>                <p>Screen readers can only speak text. This text need not be            displayed on the screen. Graphics, videos, animation, and            bitmapped text are illegible to screen readers unless there            is a textual label or textual description associated with the            graphic object. This is achieved using alternative text            attributes, linked descriptive files for images, or textual            alternatives for image buttons, applets, background images,            image maps, or video files. The HTML specification and the            file formats must accommodate these textual labels and            descriptions and the individual authors must include them in            the document.</p>                <h3>Document Accessibility Checkers</h3>                <p>Principles and guidelines for creating web pages which are            accessible to people who use assistive technology are well            documented (<a href="http://trace.wisc.edu/world/web/index.html">http://trace.wisc.edu/world/web/index.html</a>,            <a href="http://www.yuri.org/webable/index.html">http://www.yuri.org/webable/index.html</a>,            <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/">http://idrc.ocad.ca</a>).            Advocacy groups exist which review web sites and inform            authors who produce inaccessible web pages (<a href="http://www.yuri.org/webable/index.html">http://www.yuri.org/webable/index.html</a>).            However, the content on the Web will not become accessible            unless every Web author has the will and knowledge needed to            create accessible documents. Given that authors range from            school children, to corporations, academics, and government            organizations it is highly unlikely that an education and            advocacy campaign would reach all authors. Authors who            are aware of the need to make their documents            accessible and wish to do so can use services such as            &quot;Bobby.&quot; Bobby is a validation utility which checks documents            for access barriers and advises authors on how to fix the            barriers (<a href="http://www.cast.org/bobby/index.html">http://www.cast.org:80/bobby/index.html</a>).</p>                <p><br /> <br />                         </p>                <h2>Support for Creating Accessible Documents in Authoring            Tools</h2>                <p>A more effective method of reaching a large number of            authors may be to provide the necessary prompting, education            and supports in HTML authoring software. The majority of            authors use Web authoring tools and the percentage who prefer            authoring tools to manual HTML markup is increasing. Thus            authoring tools can be used to inform a wide range of authors            of the need to create accessible documents. Clear, easy to            follow guidelines and prompts can be provided and as many            modifications as possible can be automated using wizards or            other utilities.</p>                <p>Barriers which would be addressed through these authoring            supports could include:</p>                <ul> <li>missing alternative text for images</li><li>missing alternative text for buttons or image                 links</li><li>use of server-side image maps without textual                 alternatives</li><li>missing alternative text descriptions for                 applets</li><li>background images</li><li>marquee or blinking text</li><li>use of inaccessible form elements</li><li>ambiguous link names (e.g., click here)</li><li>non-separated links</li><li>missing descriptive text or captions for an audio                 file</li><li>missing descriptive text for a video file.</li> </ul>                <p>Guidance and help files would provide justifications for            recommendations as well as tips on writing useful alternative            text, or textual descriptions. A utility which simulates the            presentation of the authors document using a screen reader or            screen magnifier could be included to illustrate            recommendations and assist the author in visualizing the            needs of screen reader or screen magnifier users. An            accessibility checker, similar to a spell checker, could            check both new documents, existing documents and imported            documents for access barriers. When barriers are detected the            author could be automatically linked to the appropriate            dialog boxes and guidelines needed to modify the            document.</p>                <p>A viable method of providing access to Web pages by screen            readers (as well as text browsers or low bandwidth clients)            is to provide a parallel text-only site which provides all            the information of the standard site in text form. Problems            encountered with this approach are that: while the standard            site gets updated the text-only site is neglected and quickly            becomes out of date. A wizard which automates the creation of            the text-only site as much as possible and ensures that the            text site is updated when the standard site is updated would            help to alleviate this problem.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h2>Exploiting Document and Site Manipulation Tools</h2>                <p>In order to efficiently find information in web based            documents we rely upon our ability to sift through and ignore            irrelevant information. This can be assisted by well            structured, hierarchical documents. We want to get a quick            overview and then efficiently zero in on the items of            interest rather than going sequentially through all the            possible items. Using the visually communicated document            structure to guide us we move with agility in and out of            various levels of a document. With presently available            systems, this same mobility cannot be achieved when using            screen readers or screen magnifiers.</p>                <p>&quot;Luckily,&quot; screen size is finite, as is the size of            legible or recognizable text or graphics. Consequently, users            without visual impairments feel restricted in the amount of            information they can view at one time when attempting to read            large complex documents. Software developers have responded            to these challenges by creating tools or utilities which make            it easier to read, navigate through and manipulate large WEB            or Intranet documents or sites.            These tools address problems which are similar, but greatly            intensified, when using screen readers or screen magnifiers.            Consequently, they can be exploited to make information            retrieval and document manipulation more efficient for users            of screen readers or screen magnifiers.</p>                <p>These tools include:</p>                <ul> <li>navigators or dynamic, expandable tree views of a                 document</li><li>dynamic tables of contents</li><li>personal document views</li><li>context sensitive searching</li><li>annotations, and</li><li>on-demand delivery of information.</li> </ul>                <h3>Dynamic Tables of Contents</h3>                <p>Navigators provide an outline of a document using the            structure expressed in HTML. This outline can be expanded or            compressed similar to a tree view of a file structure. Thus a            great deal of detail can be displayed about one area of a            document while only the general headers are displayed about            another area. The user can navigate up and down through the            document and &quot;in and out&quot; of the levels of detail. Dynamic            tables of contents (TOCs) allow users to determine what will            be listed as table of content items, for example: headers,            images, figures, or tables. These table of contents or tree            structures can also display multiple hyperlinked documents.            The WEB of documents is translated into a tree structure by            specifying a point of view. Points of views or top-level            documents can be changed, thereby changing the tree            structure.</p>                <p>These navigators or tables of contents have obvious            advantages for users of screen readers. To exploit these            resources, keyboard equivalents must be provided to move            through and manipulate the TOCs. In addition, the document            levels of the various items should be expressed using audio            or vocal cues. Thus, screen reader users can get a sense of            what the document or site looks like overall, and then zero            in on specifics.</p>                <h3>Personal Document Views</h3>                <p>Certain Intranet publishing tools allow the specification            of personal views of a document. Thus the same document can            be viewed with a different page layout, with more or less            detail, or with a different emphasis on certain pieces of            information. A personalized view for users of screen readers,            with particular areas of relevance or interest hi-lited,            would make document viewing and information retrieval much            easier.</p>                <h3>Document Annotation</h3>                <p>Tools exist which allow annotation of documents by both            content creators and users. These annotations could be used            by access system users to hi-lite or mark areas of particular            interest or to add text labels where they are missing. Thus            areas of interest could be quickly found again and            clarification of an inaccessible item would only need to be            obtained once. Combined with dynamic TOCs, a truly            personalized table of contents could be created.</p>                <h3>Context Specific Search Tools</h3>                <p>Dynamic TOCs can be further enhanced by search tools which            search within specific documents or sites. The results could            be displayed in dynamic tables of content. If these can be            easily navigated using keyboard equivalents they would            provide the equivalent of visually scanning the document for            content of interest. When loading a document an option could            be to create a dynamic TOC of items related to a number of            areas of personal interest. Thus the user who is blind or            visually impaired could quickly assess whether the document            has information matching their interests.</p>                <h3>Dynamic Information Retrieval Utilities</h3>                <p>Additional tools, which would greatly benefit users of            alternative access systems, are dynamic information retrieval            utilities which alert the user to newly posted items of            interest. Unfortunately these are frequently not            accessible.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h2>Conclusion</h2>                <p>The visual channel and purely visual conventions are            heavily relied upon to communicate the structure, the            emphasis and the content of Web and Intranet documents. While            the visual channel lends itself well to targeted document            navigation, the aural channel encourages sequential document            viewing. Through work on various fronts, strategies and tools            are being developed which afford the same information            retrieval and document manipulation capabilities to users of            screen readers and screen magnifiers.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>                <p>The author would like to acknowledge the following ATRC            staff for their insightful input into this paper: Jan            Richards, Dena Shumila, and Kevin Nguyen.</p> 	</div>
