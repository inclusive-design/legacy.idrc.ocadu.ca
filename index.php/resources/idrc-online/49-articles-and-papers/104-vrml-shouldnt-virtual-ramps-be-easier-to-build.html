<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is an evolving             standard for the creation and distribution of interactive             distributed virtual environments on the Internet. Currently             VRML is restricted to the creation of static three dimensional             (3-D) objects. These objects may serve as links to other             Internet resources by specifying a Universal Resource Locator             (URL). Future developments of VRML are expected to incorporate             sound, behaviors, agents, and multi-user environments. In its             final form VRML will allow Internet users from any part of the             globe to interact with each other and created animate or             inanimate objects in a three dimensional virtual environment.             VRML offers the same fundamental strengths as the WWW. It is             platform independent, an open standard, and designed to work             over a low bandwidth.</p>
<p>This paper will briefly outline the current status of VRML             as well as the associated access challenges. We will discuss             future VRML standards and the potential challenges they will             offer. As VRML is in it's infancy this paper is largely             conceptual. Many of the current standards and future             standards have yet to be implemented. Therefore, we intend to             provide an initial framework to address these upcoming             challenges. People have often speculated that virtualreality             (VR) and virtual environments (VEs) will be of great benefit             to persons with disabilities. We will try to describe the             subsystem or infrastructure required to support possible             benefits. We will expand to show that the challenges presented             by future implementations and developments of VRML go             far beyond the challenges encountered in a 2D Graphical User             Interface. VRML not only introduces a third dimension but a             whole new way of representing and interacting with             information. These challenges cannot be met by simply             expanding the appropriate software hooks to accommodate             presently available access tools.</p>
<p>Theoretically, access challenges in a virtual world should             be easier to deal with than in the real world. All information             transmitted is computer mediated and can therefore be             filtered, translated, amplified or attenuated depending on the             needs of the user and the demands of the task. What is needed             is the will and a clear knowledge of what is required by the             user. In a constrained virtual environment we can predict and             provide the required accommodations for specific tasks and             specific users. Distributed virtual worlds introduce some of             the unpredictability of the real world. The authors of the             virtual world do not know who the users are, what platform             they are working on, what browser they are using, how many             users will be in their environment, or what the users will do             to the objects in the environment or to each other. Likewise             when generating guidelines for VRML we must contend with the             fact that VRML is meant to be generally extensible and should             ideally serve many different applications (e.g.,games,             scientific visualization, simulation, social interaction             etc.).</p>
<p>The access challenges of VRML subsume all of the access             challenges we haveencountered thus far. At this point we have             a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>VRML is in its infancy and we have the opportunity                  to influence its development,</li>
<li>presently VRML is a standard, influencing the                  standard will affect all applications,</li>
<li>developers of VR and VRML are concerned with the                  human experience and therefore have the tools and the                  motivation to consider human interface challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>VRML like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language on the World             Wide Web), has a standardized language specification for             material published on the Internet, associated authoring tools             to create the material, and browsers to allow usersto view             the material. In order to make VRML accessible we must             address the design and development of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the VRML specification,</li>
<li>VRML browsers,</li>
<li>VRML authoring tools,</li>
<li>VRML display methods, and</li>
<li>VRML control tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, presently available alternative access             systems need to becompletely reconceptualized and             retooled.</p>
<p>While VRML is in its infancy, VRML developers have been             very open and responsive to suggestions for specific changes             or additions to the VRML specifications or browser. It is now             the responsibility of the access communityto come up with             generally accepted guidelines on how to provide access. We             need to know what we want in order to provide guidance to             developers and designers. We cannot simply insist upon access,             we must be able to articulate how. We must also reach a             consensus so that we do not confuse developers with             conflicting recommendations and requests. In order to do this             we need to answer some as yet unanswered questions in a large             variety of fields including inter-human communication,             navigation, manipulation, vision, audition, haptics,             and information processing, to name a few. We need to develop             a better understanding and quantification of how various             individuals contend with the real world, what structures and             tools do they depend upon? A few specific questions to             be answered include: how do we best communicate complex             simultaneous real time events which are presented visually in             alternative formats, what level of information is optimal to             allow someone to make a timely and informed decision,what is             a good balance between intelligent assistance and open ended             choice making?</p>

<h3>The VRML Standards Process</h3>
<p>The development of the VRML specification is a multi-step             process with features or additional capabilities being             implemented in each version of the specification. VRML 1.0             simply allows for the display of three dimensional graphics             which can serve as links to other sites on the World Wide             Web. Among the additions to be included in VRML 1.1 is sound             and animation. VRML 2.0 is expected to include behaviors             (objects behave based on time and events), interactions (a way             to feed events into environments), multiple participants,and             telepresence.</p>
<p>To facilitate the rapid construction of the first             specification, it was voted bythe members of the WWW-VRML             mailing list to adopt a subset of SGI's OpenInventor and to             add nodes to support interaction with the World Wide Web             (WWW)(Pesce et.al., 1994). Through the combined efforts of             the WWW-VRML list members,SGI, and Template Graphic Services             (TGS), VRML has been acknowledged as the standard for 3D             display on the Internet by numerous universities,             corporations and institutions such as Mosaic Communications             Corp., DEC, NSCA, and others. The design process is driven by             the suggestion and debating of various features onthe             WWW-VRML list, then the strongest and most applicable             proposals are introduced into the specification by its             authors. Following this, a draft is submitted for review and             comment towards the final specification. There is also a move             to bring VRML to the Internet Engineering Task Force             (IETF).</p>

<h3>VRML 1.0</h3>
<p>A comprehensive description of the VRML 1.0 specification             is beyond the scope of this paper. For the access designer             there are seven key elements to consider. These elements are             the hierarchical ordering of the scene graph, the geometric             description of objects and object properties, information             nodes, the description field in the WWW Anchor node, the ASCII             text node, and the coordinate system.</p>
<p>VRML files are distributed and composed in ".wrl" or world             files. Contained within these files are the geometric             descriptions of objects, their ordering and properties,             environmental information, and reference to additional objects             such as wrl, jpeg, or au files. At the heart of VRML is the             scene graph. It is this which provides a hierarchical             structure for ordering and implementing the nodes within a             scene. The node is the basic building block used to create the             scene. Each node holds a piece of information, such as a             surface material, shape description, or geometric             transformation. All 3D shapes, attributes, cameras and light             sources present in a scene are represented as nodes             (JosieWernecke, 1994). Nodes which proceed can have effect             upon nodes which follow in the scene graph. Some types of             nodes can contain other nodes, these are referred to as group             nodes or parent and child nodes respectively (Bell et al.             1995).</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the scene graph provides an             overall structure for the inclusion of objects within a scene.             Further, the hierarchical structure provides information             regarding the relationship of objects. Using             coordinate information, 3D spatial information regarding             object placement can be ascertained. The geometric description             provides information regarding object, shape, size, and             properties (i.e. material, color, transparency, etc.).             Given this information, it is feasible to provide several             methods of alternative representation and interaction at the             user interface level.</p>
<p>It may be possible to use the constrained context and             logical structural information dictated by the scene graph,             geometry, properties, spatial positioning and supplementary             information provided by ASCII text for use by a browser to             construct user relative representations of virtual             environments through general filtering and agents. For             example, a file could be parsed to provide the auditory output             of "small qchair brown. It is one meter from your current             position. Small transparent partly shiny table .5 meters             ahead. "One obvious problem with this is the presentation of             the world information is not in accordance with natural             language. Further, any significance of the chair that may have             been intended to be communicated visually will be lost.             For example, the chair is in fact the chair for a Queen and is             made of beautiful oak, and for the world and the task at hand             this is significant. However, as the scene is parsed, the size             of the chair was determined relative to the environment space             and other objects present. Visually, this chair was             larger than and quite elaborate compared to chairs in general,             yet this could not be determined automatically. Additionally,             the obstacle provided by the table would cause difficulties             for navigation. There are possible methods to             provide additional information for the experiencer to allow             them to gain a greater understanding of the world.</p>
<p>The four final key factors come into play now. First is             the info node. Generally used to communicate copyright and             author information, this node can additionally carry general             text strings which can be used for providing broader             descriptions of an environment and its objects. Next, the             ASCIItext node takes an ASCII textstring and presents this as             a 3D representation in the world. This node works             incooperation with the FontStyle node which provides             information about a font's style, family, and size. Finally             the WWWAnchor node can contain a description of links. Through             this we have the possibility of providing higher             level descriptions.</p>
<p>The following description illustrates a possible method of             providing auditory access to the visual scene using the             elements listed above. Upon entering theworld, an info node             could state, "This is the public chamber for the Queen.This             is where she makes big decisions. She has used money             purloined from the peasants to elaborately design and decorate             this chamber." So now the person has a general sense of the             context and properties of the room. Most importantly the user             now has a sense of context. They now know that if they             are looking for the Queen's private chambers they are in the             wrong room but they are getting close. What is needed is a             high level description of objects in the space so they can             decide whether to explore or leave. To achieve the             equivalent of a quick visual scan of the objects in the room a             list of objects may now be presented auditorally. Upon hearing             the object name qchair, this Sparks interest as other chairs             were named chair. They now request additional information             about the chair. In essence what they have done is isolated an             area of the scene graph and now they desire to traverse the             child nodes of the parent node associatedwith the chair. The             first child node section containsMaterial/ASCIItext/FontStyle             nodes which are interpreted auditorally as "largegolden shiny             metal text Queen Becky Rules". The user now knows this is             theQueens chair and there may be something around it of             interest. Further interpreting the scene graph the text             description for a WWWAnchor node is read:"sit (click) in the             chair and be transported to the Queens private             chamber."Great! This is the goal of the user and it was             accomplished by presenting highlevel information for             executive decision making and then interpreting             selective lower level descriptions. All irrelevant information             could be ignored, such as the hand position on the grandfather             clock across the room.</p>
<p>Some of the components necessary for the implementation of             the above proposed approach have been incorporated in the VRML             specification upon the suggestion of the authors, namely the             ASCII text node, description fields in the WWW Anchorand             possible use of the info node in describing meta scene             information inaddition to the copyright description. Despite             the availability of these features, such a proposal is             admittedly brittle. It is highly dependent upon alogical             hierarchical structure within the scene graph. Secondly it is             reliant upon text descriptions being added to the scene using             a node whose primary purpose is to provide other             information.</p>
<p>Similar principles, to those discussed above, could be             employed for assistingnavigation. An example is demonstrated             by the SeekTool in Web Space (a VRMLbrowser, SGI 1995). This             tool allows a user to click on an object, causing             their position to be automatically adjusted to close proximity             to the object. This eliminates the need for laborious and             complex manipulation of input devices. The same approach could             be applied to create virtual guide dogs which accept             high level instructions.</p>
<p>Another access approach is to explore alternative display             methods and alternative input methods. An additional channel             for the presentation of spatial and object related information             is haptic input. It is quite feasible that geometry, shape and             properties could be presented through the use             offorce-feedback and tactors. Unfortunately, such a hardware             setup is currently very economically prohibitive. Further             research and development is required inthis area.</p>
<p>It is hoped that, despite varying contexts of individual             virtual environments; objects, structures and properties are             consistent elements and can be utilizedto develop a general             method of interpreting the world, based upon userabilities,             goals and needs. Critical to this is a logical             hierarchical structure, consistent input/output protocols, and             the cooperation of VRML authors, all of which may be             threatened by independent commercial developments and economic             pressures. In order to accomplish even the modest level of             access described in the example, modifications must also be             made to the VRML browsers and authoring tools. A preliminary             discussion of the issues to be considered follows.</p>
<p><a name="browsers" title="browsers"></a></p>
<h3>VRML Browsers</h3>
<p>Currently there are no browsers capable of supporting the             user actions described in the above example. In fact, some do             not support even access fundamentals such as keyboard             equivalents. Ideally VRML browsers should support the type of             user navigation and exploration described above, should             provide basic access features and should be compatible with             alternative access control and display systems. Before browser             developers can begin to provide these accommodations we must             develop generally accepted access system guidelines             and standards. Unfortunately this may mean developing             radically new access technology. Currently available screen             reading packages are of little use, a completely different             paradigm is used to present information and             possible interactions. Once these standards are developed we             must insure that the standards processes are met and that             companies do not deviate from standards(like Netscape             has).</p>
<p>There are new browsers becoming available on a weekly             basis, with many more indevelopment. Currently SGI's Webspace             (SGI 1995) is the only browser available in full release             supporting all of VRML 1.0 features. Template Graphic             Servicesis working with SGI to port Webspace to other             platforms such as Windows NT (TGS1995). InterVista's             WorldView (Parisi 1995) is the only VRML browser             available currently for Windows 3.1. These and others (Serflek             1995c) are in various stages of development. Source code is             available for Webspace, and is promised tobe available for             IICM, NSCA and the University of Minnesota's VRWeb when             it reaches its release stage (Hardenburgh, 1995).</p>
<p>The ATRC is presently seeking support to develop             accessibility utilities forVRML browsers. Given the level of             development of VRML in general, this support may not become             available in the immediate future.</p>
<p><a name="tools" title="tools"></a></p>
<h3>VRML Authoring Tools</h3>
<p>A number of VRML authoring tools are emerging on the             market. One example being Ez3d (Radiance,1995) a 3D package             which can output VRML files. Virtus has also created a VRML             tool (Virtus, 1995) as have a number of             other companies(Serflek 1995c). In addition to the authoring             tools there are conversion tools available which allow the             conversion of existing 3D files into the .wrl format.</p>
<p>Of greatest importance is the type of VRML file produced             by these tools. It isconceivable that a file can be produced             which looks identical to an accessible file (when displayed)             but contains none of the structural information             orhierarchical organization needed to provide access. We             should investigate wayswhich VRML could be structured via the             scene graph that would not affect the normal use of VRML, but             would aid in parsing the file by limiting the number             of variants to contend with. This may be as simple as             encouraging developers to incorporate a recommended order for             information that would otherwise be ordered in an arbitrary             manner. By modifying authoring and conversion tools we             can affect a large amount of material published, as VRML files             will rarely be prepared by hand, VRML authoring being much             more challenging than HTML. We must also work with authoring             tool manufactures to increase the accessibility of             the software.</p>
<p><a name="one-one" title="one-one"></a></p>
<h3>VRML 1.1</h3>
<p>Shortly, a draft specification for version 1.1 of VRML             will be released. Features expected to be included in the             draft are simple animation, il 8n text, caching of objects             (i.e. on a CD-ROM), video streams as textures,             annotation text, and possibly both ambient and localized sound             (Hardenbergh 1995, Pesce1995). A much desired feature is the             addition of annotation text. This addition will allow for a             textual description of various media (i.e. images,             sounds,objects). This annotation will have benefits even if             it is difficult to derive aliteral text interpretation of a             media. In our work with HTML, we have learned that alternate             text can be even more beneficial if it provides             functional information about the document. For example, a logo             serves to distinguish a page and give an indication of the             content of the document. Additionally, an image map allows a             viewer to quickly ascertain the resources and functional             aspects of a document. Through small pilot studies, we have             found that primary importance should be placed on providing a             general sense of the context and content. This allows a user             to develop a mental model. Put simply, it is just as             important if not more important to state "why" than to state             "what".</p>
<p>To fully utilize the annotation text possibilities two             conditions must be met.First, a greater understanding of             effective placement of the annotation textnode within the             scene graph must be determined. The annotation node in             1.1 provides an official method of providing high level             descriptive information,thereby replacing the unofficial use             of the info node in VRML 1.0.</p>
<p>The second and primary condition for the success of             annotation text is it mustbe utilized. As it will be             generated by humans, there is no assurance that             this information will be available or be accurate. This             strongly indicates the need to find methods to complement the             annotation text information. However, onepossible avenue             exists. It is likely that there will be strong growth in             thedistribution of CD-ROM's and sites for 3D models. These             models would serve either as alternatives methods of viewing             high traffic sites or as the VRML equivalent of clip-art. It             should be possible to encourage the distributors of this             material to add descriptions of these objects. This would             form the basis oflower level descriptions of objects in             scenes. This would mean that authors need only to provide             descriptions for the scene as a whole and for             complementary media.</p>
<p>The inclusion of sound will be of additional benefit in             providing audio cues. Ambient sounds will provide a general             sense of the environment as a whole. Localized sound will aid             in providing directional cues if the auditory information is             presented as 3D. The inclusion of sound will necessitate             the development of a captioning strategy appropriate for a 3             dimensional environment. This may entail 3D display of             captioning as well as multimedia captions incorporating             animation and video clips.</p>
<p><a name="two-zero" title="two-zero"></a></p>
<h3>VRML 2.0</h3>
<p>With the introduction of 2.0 features VRML will become             much more excitingand enjoy more general applicability for a             variety of uses. It will become avery important standard. The             planned features to be added are behaviors (objectsbehave             based on time and events), interactions (a way to feed events             intoenvironments), multiple participants, telepresence, and             sound if it was not implemented in the VRML 1.1 specification             (Hardenbergh 1995). This new standard will subsume previous             access solutions and challenges. To understand             the infrastructure through which this will be accomplished, it             is useful to divide the main components into three main             categories: Geometry, distribution ortransportation             protocols, and behaviors. Nevertheless this is all             very speculative as this is still very much under debate.             Additionally this distinction is somewhat arbitrary as the             three components are largely intertwined and dependent upon             each other.</p>
<p><a name="geo" title="geo"></a></p>
<h3>Geometry</h3>
<p>It is difficult to foresee what additional changes or             additions to geometrywill be added to VRML 2.0. Likely, these             will be extensions to VRML 1.1 (i.e.,adding additional nodes             and refining existing nodes and their usage and properties or             the addition of other features from Open Inventor). It is             not anticipated that this will introduce any additional major             access concerns.However, as we learn more about access needs             we may wish to introduce minor changes to enhance access.</p>
<p><a name="comm" title="comm"></a></p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>The current method of distributing VRML environments by             means of aclient/server approach utilizing HTTP will not be             possible for 2.0 features. Ithas become necessary to work             towards developing a Virtual Reality Transportation Protocol             (VRTP). This is necessary for several reasons, the primary             reason beingthat present methods do not meet design             assumptions regarding bandwidth, latency, efficiency (Brutzman             1995), and compatibility (Roehl 1995a). It may be necessary to             adopt different types of communication for different tasks.             One possible method of meeting the requirements of bandwidth,             low latency, efficiency and compatibility is to divide             communication into four maincategories: Light-weight             Interactions, Network Pointers, Heavy-weight Objects,and             Real-time Streams. (Brutzman 1995)</p>
<ul>
<li>Light-weight interactions give information which can                  be used to update the position and velocity of an entity.                  They may also give information about status.This                  information is not sent continuously. In order to                  increase efficiency and decrease bandwidth requirements                  strategies are employed which update theinformation only                  if the status has changed a predefined amount, or at                  preset time intervals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Network Pointers are used to update each member's                  registry of all other members in a multicast group. Both                  Light-weight interactions and network pointers can be                  transmitted through more efficient, less reliable                  means.</li>
<li>Heavy-Weight Objects encompass interactions which                  must transmit large amounts of data in a reliable manner                  such as .wrl's, gif's, etc. Heavy-Weight Objects will                  likely continue to employ http or http-ng.</li>
<li>Real-time Streams refers to information which must                  be communicated in realtime such as live video, audio,                  etc. This will likely be done using                  multicast channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is much work do be done in improving and enhancing             the current methodsof Distributed Interactive Simulation             communication (Brutzman 1995). There is doubt that current             methods of communication can be generalized to supportgeneral             VE's and complicated non-deterministic behaviors (Roehl             1995). There is a move to have current methods of network             communication form the basis of thelow level behavior and             develop new schemes to handle more complex             behaviors. Priorities used to select the methods of             communication may not match therequirements of the access             features. These decisions will need to be             carefully monitored.</p>
<p><a name="behaviour" title="behaviour"></a></p>
<h3>Behaviour</h3>
<p>There are two main competing proposals for incorporating             behavior in VRML.This first is to incorporate Open Inventors             sensors and engines (Brutzman 1995).There is little detail             and little support for this approach.</p>
<p>The second is based on Roehl's (1995b) working paper on             behaviors. Roehl(1995b) suggests several levels of behavior             based upon the extent the behavioris determined or             predictable. For example a mountain is very determined,             thebehavior of a clock would be largely predictable, a             foraging squirrel may have aset of goals but the method of             executing the goals is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Lower level behaviors (e.g., the mountain and the clock)             can be transmittedusing communication methods for             light-weight interactions discussed above. Greater difficulty             and controversy is associated with higher level             behaviors.There is little agreement as to whether there             should be a standard behavioral description language, what             that language should be, whether the behavioral description             should be tied to the object or separate from the object and             how the information should be transmitted. As yet it is hard             to determine which approach would be beneficial from an access             perspective.</p>
<p>Behaviors will present challenges that are new and             complex. We must interpretbehaviors given available             information and present meaningful descriptions, avoiding             cognitively taxing descriptions such as "arm rotating.04             metersper second on the Y axis," in order to communicate that             a glass is being "pickedup". The introduction of less             predictable behaviors in multi-user environments will             complicate matters.</p>

<h3>Agent do, Agent do too?</h3>
<p>An interesting approach could be developed in distributed             environments which include multicasting, this approach is             modeled on real life. The presence ofother users in the             environment can be used to assist the user of an             alternative access system. We can collect data on how others             are behaving in a VE and use this information to present a             limited set of meaningful choices to the user of an             alternative access system thereby reducing the number of             necessary steps required to complete a goal and giving lower             priority to choices which are inappropriate for the situation.             This can be done in a non-interfering/non-invasive manner.</p>
<p>Consider the following situation. A person is walking             through the forest with agroup of friends. The group as a             whole happened to be members of the Saskquatch Appreciation             Society. Suddenly there is loud noise from behind a specific             groupof bushes and a loud roar. Apparently, the Saskquatch             does not wish to be appreciated as the members of the society             quickly assess. At this point, most members deduce that it is             best to leave and leave quickly. This is a flight orflight             situation, quick reaction time is essential. One member of             the group hasonly one voluntary control utilizing a single             switch. Even if this had occurred directly in front of her, or             if someone yelled "RUN!!", she would havehad difficulty             navigating herself away quickly enough to have a good             laughlater. Agents could detect that upon the arrival of the             new entity, the majorityof previously present entities             suddenly and quickly moved away from that specific entity. As             all update information for all users is             potentially transmitted to all other members, the woman's             browser could now present her withthe option "run". Upon             selecting this option the browser could automatically move the             user's avitar in a similar speed and direction as allothers             in the group. It is important to note that the user remains             in control,other choices are available, and the user can             choose to ignore the priority choices presented.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In meeting the access challenges of VRML we should avoid             "regressive"solutions, we should not insist that developers             include previous generation technology or translate new             information structures into old forms. We shouldexploit the             new technology and the new possibilities and direct them to             meet ourneeds.</p>
<p>It is imperative that the access community develop             generally acceptedguidelines on how to provide access. We             need to know what we want in order toprovide guidance to             developers and designers. We cannot simply insist upon access,             we must be able to articulate how. We must also reach a             consensus sothat we do not confuse developers with             conflicting recommendations and requests.</p>
<p>VRML presents access challenges which surpass anything we             have faced so far.It also presents tools which are more             powerful than any we have had at our disposal to date.</p>
