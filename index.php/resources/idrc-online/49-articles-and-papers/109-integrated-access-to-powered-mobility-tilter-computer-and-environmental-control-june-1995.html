		<p>Bert Shire, John McAlpine, Linda Petty, Chris Ridpath, Larry            Silver, Ed Snell            Bloorview Children&#39;s Hospital<br /> Willowdale, Ontario, CANADA</p>                         <h3><a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/rd/library/papers/integAcc.html#ref"> </a></h3>           <h3>Abstract</h3>              <p>For individuals with progressive degenerative disorders            technology reduces the effect of disability on active and            vital lifestyles. As more and more pieces of technology are            added to an individual&#39;s system it is important that an            overall perspective of the client, their needs, and their            existing technology be considered. A smooth integration of            new and existing technology can increase the functionally and            potential of the entire system. This paper describes the            prescription and integration of a computer access system with            powered mobility, powered tilt system, portable ventilator,            and environmental control. </p>                         <h3>Background</h3>              <p>John is twenty four years old, has a diagnosis of            Duchehenne&#39;s Muscular Dystrophy and has required full time            ventilation for the past six years. He uses powered mobility,            has interests in vocational pursuits and enjoys recreational            reading. Formally an inpatient of Bloorview Children&#39;s            Hospital, John is currently living in an apartment supported            by attendant care services and assistive devices.</p>                <p>The powered mobility system is based upon an Invacare            Arrow with an MCC MK III controller and 1551 switch option            interface. The Roho seating is incorporated into a TARSYS            tilt-in-space system with a QUAX interface. The QUAX allows            the use of a single input switch to alternately control UP            and DOWN movement of the tilt-in-space system. The            tilt-in-space system provides independent pressure relief            controlled through a low force (.98 Newtons) microswitch            accessed by John&#39;s right thumb. Careful consideration was            given to mounting a portable ventilator (1)(2) on the powered            wheelchair. The mobility system was supplied in 1993.</p>                <p>Dual modes of control for the powered mobility system were            provided through a short throw joystick and a sip and puff            interface. Originally the sip and puff interface was intended            to be used when fatigue and cold temperatures prevented use            of the short throw joystick. Latched sip and puff, adjusted            for the most sensitive pneumatic levels, has now become the            exclusive access method for mobility. A second low force            microswitch (mounted adjacent to the tilt-in space            microswitch and also accessed by the right thumb) was            provided to select modes on the MCC controller. These modes            are STANDBY, DRIVE A DRIVE B, SPEED 1, SPEED 2, SPEED 3, and            ECU 1 and are stepped through sequentially each activation of            the microswitch. DRIVE A and DRIVE B were setup to represent            short throw joystick and pip and puff control schemes            respectively.</p>                <p>ECU l on the MCC controller provides four dry contact            relay outputs with a common ground. Each the relay outputs            can be selected by respective activations of the mobility            interface s FWD, REV LEFT and RIGHT directions. Two of the            outputs were used to control a two channel Stanley door            transmitter which John used to open his apartment door and            apartment building front door. The other two outputs were            used to control the Bloorview Wireless Switch Link            transmitter. The Bloorview Wireless Switch link is a dual            channel, radio frequency, transmitter/receiver set which            provides wireless switch access to stationary equipment. In            John&#39;s case this accessed the CHEC 2 (3) integrated            environmental control system and allowed him control his home            entertainment equipment, telephone and other devices involved            in daily living. A Bloorview Battery Adaptor (4) converts the            24 volt wheelchair batteries into three independently            adjustable voltages. Two of these voltages powers the Stanley            door transmitter and the Wireless Switch Link to eliminate            the need for disposable batteries.</p>                <p>For written communication John had used a series adaptive            devices that changed as his needs increased and his physical            abilities declined. His first computer, an IBM AT was            initially accessed through the keyboard and a hand held            pencil. As range movement and fatigue became a problem, the            Bloorview Mini-keyboard (5) was developed for John&#39; This was            a small, 7&quot; x 2 1/2&quot;, keyboard based on the Sharp PC-1360            Pocket Computer, requiring only grams of force to activate            the keys. John acquired donated Amiga computer in 1989 for            graphics and game use. His functional range of movement and            available strength had decreased to the point however where            the Mini-keyboard no longer could meet h needs. The            technologist and programmer at Bloorview Children&#39;s hospital            adapted the Amiga to accept two switch mouse cursor control            and Morse code character input John continued to use this            computer until his move to an attendant care apartment two            years ago.</p>                <p>John&#39;s mobility and environmental control systems continue            to &quot;evolve&#39; with his changing needs. Most ,recently his needs            have been directed towards desk top publishing as a            vocational goal and the tools necessary for this achievement.            John requested the Writing Aid Clinic at Bloorview Children&#39;s            Hospital to review his personal writing aid needs.</p>                         <h3>Assessment</h3>              <p>There was the presence of bilateral elbow flexion            contractures in the left arm of 105 degrees and right arm of            90 degrees. Wrist flexion contractures were also present with            a left wrist flexion contracture of 105 degrees and right            wrist of 95 degrees which restricted functional hand use.            Bilateral arm troughs had been provided to stabilize the            elbows and forearms. Any movement against gravity was            difficult for John.</p>                <p>It was decided to try a Macintosh based system with john.            A wide range of commercial software specific to John&#39;s            educational and career goals was available for the Macintosh.            Several options for the alternate access required by John            were also available. Ke:nx operating as the single switch            Morse input device was chosen as the alternate access method            because of John&#39;s pervious experience with Morse code. A TASH            mouse emulator to provide on screen cursor control through            John&#39;s wheelchair ECU output was obtained and the system            assembled for trials.</p>                <p>John had functional use of both his right thumb and his            left little finger being able to exert forces of .49 and .61            Newtons respectively. The right thumb was already operating            his wheelchair seating tilt system and his wheelchair            controller mode select functions through two low force            microswitches. A third low force microswitch was placed            beside and anterior to the first and second switches. This            was however at the extreme functional range of John&#39;s            right-hand thumb. fatigue would quickly set in given the            thumb extension required to reach the switch and the high            number of separate activations needed to input Morse. John s            left hand and specifically his left little finger was now            free for other functions with the recent switch to sip and            puff for wheelchair control The available force of .61            Newtons was enough to operate low torque microswitch. It was            anticipated however that fatigue would still be a problem            given the number of activations needed to generate Morse            code. A capacitive touch switch which has the characteristics            of zero travel to activate and near zero Contact force (6)            was chosen as the Morse input switch to help minimize            fatigue. The capacitive touch switch plugged directly into            the Ke:nx hardware box and the Ke:nx Morse code software            setup was loaded as the Macintosh power on configuration.</p>                <p>The second ECU output of the Arrow wheelchair controller            was enabled. A custom 9 pin cable was constructed to connect            the ECU 2 outputs to the TASH Mouse Emulator providing John            mouse cursor movement control through his wheelchair sip and            puff control system. The &quot;Mouse Select&quot; was activated by the            third microswitch accessed by John&#39;s right thumb and its            output tied into the 9 pin cable.</p>                <p>Sip and puff control of the mouse proved to be a problem            during training. John experienced difficulty in maintaining            the &quot;hard&quot; puff needed to move the mouse&#39;s cursor up screen.            There was also the combined effect of using the wheelchair            sip and puff control with the TASH mouse emulator a            combination which produced on screen mouse movements too            coarse for easy control. Intended targets were overshot and            considerable cursor repositioning was required.</p>                <p>At this point it was decided to try the Bloorview Mini            Morse (7) for mouse emulation through the touch switch            inputting of Morse code control sequences (7). This would be            a less direct method of mouse cursor control than using the            directional ECU 2 outputs 1 did prove to provide better            control of the cursor due to the Mini Morse&#39;s ramped speed            mouse cursor movement.</p>                <p>Morse input to Ke:nx had also proved to be a problem as            the Morse code speed adjustment was not fine enough to meek            John&#39;s needs The Mini Morse was also be able to emulate the            Macintosh keyboard directly from the Morse coded character            input stream (from the capacitive touch switch). The Mini            Morse was able to replace the Ke:nx hardware/software as well            as the TASH mouse emulator. The microswitch remained as the            mouse select.</p>                <p>It became apparent that the cables required between John&#39;s            wheelchair and the computer system would become a problem.            First they required another person to connect them each time            John wished to use his computer. Second there would be long            term durability issues as these cables were connected and            re-connected. It was John who came up with the unconventional            solution to these problems. This solution was to use his            Infrared Remote Control Pad System for his SEGA game system            as the wireless link from his wheelchair to the computer and            Mini Morse.</p>                <p>This would require adaptations to both the transmitter and            receiver of the Infrared Remote Control Pad System. The            transmitter would be mounted on the wheelchair, powered from            the wheelchair through the Bloorview Battery Adapter, which            was already powering the Wireless Switch Link and Stanley            door transmitters. The direction control pad was tapped into            and a connector provided to connect it to the wheelchair            controller&#39;s four ECU 2 outputs. The Sega &quot;Fire&quot; control            buttons B and C were also accessed by the third right-hand            microswitch acting as mouse select) and the left-hand little            finger capacitive touch switch (morse code character            output).</p>                <p>The receiver normally obtained power from the SEGA Control            Deck which would not be present when used with the computer.            It was necessary to provide it with an external AC adaptor            and DC voltage conversion circuitry. Connectors were added to            the Sega receiver to take the &quot;Fire B&quot;, &quot;Fire C&quot; and FWD            direction control pad signal and convert them into three            single switch outputs. These plugged directly into the Mini            Morse.</p>                <p>John&#39;s Mini Morse meanwhile had been modified by            Bloorview&#39;s software programmer to accept input from three            switches. Input from switch I would be decoded as Morse code            character input. A switch closure through switch input 2            would initiate a scanned mouse movement (7). Switch input 3            would act as mouse select button. This combination of            Macintosh and Mini Morse, with capacitive touch switch,            microswitch and sip and puff controlled ECU output, linked by            the SEGA remote game pad, proved to be the optimal system for            John. <a name="results" title="results"></a></p>                         <h3>Results</h3>              <p>John came to the clinic an experienced technology user with            some fairly specific ideas on what he would like from a            writing aid system and how he would like to access that            system. He was an important and integral part of the            assessment and prescription process providing insights into            the wheelchair/ECU technology that he already used. His ideas            for blending and customizing his new writing aid system, with            other available commercial technology were invaluable. The            system incorporated many parts of John&#39;s existing technology,            integrating old and new into one overall system. John now has            this system at home, providing him with independent access to            a writing aid which will help him meet his future academic            goals. </p>                         <h3>References</h3>                          <p>1.Gilgoff, 1., Montes, L.
